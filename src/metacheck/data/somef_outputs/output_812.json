It forms the core of the software that is used to create the Dutch popular-astronomy website\nhttps://hemel.waarnemen.com.  To download the libTheSky package, read the code documentation, or to contact\nthe developer, see: https://libthesky.sourceforge.net/ \nlibTheSky is written in Fortran, hence you will need a Fortran compiler.  Gfortran, part of gcc, is a free,\nopen-source Fortran compiler included in many GNU/Linux distributions and available from\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/. \nThe default installer uses CMake to configure and compile the code.  CMake is also open-source software, also\nincluded in most GNU/Linux distributions, and can be downloaded from https://www.cmake.org/.  Alternatively,\nyou can create your own Makefile or compile and link the code manually. \nlibTheSky needs the Fortran library libSUFR in order to compile and run.  libSUFR is free and open software,\nand available under the EUPL v1.2 from https://libsufr.sf.net/. \nOn a Linux system, the library and module files could be installed as:\n: /usr/lib/libTheSky.*\n: /usr/include/libTheSky/*.mod \nIf you want to use the libraries with multiple Fortran compilers, you will want to keep the different versions\nof the library separated.  In this case, use (in addition to any other options):\n #+begin_src bash\n   cmake -DCOMPILER_SPECIFIC_LIBS=on ..\n #+end_src\nThe library files will then be installed as:\n: /usr/lib/libTheSky_<NameOfFortranCompiler>.*\n: /usr/include/libTheSky/<NameOfFortranCompiler>/*.mod \nIf one of your Fortran compilers is your default, you can use both the default installation method and the\ncompiler-specific method to install the library. \n\n** Data files \nThe data files are distributed in a separate tarball, named ~libthesky-data-<YYYYMMDD>.tar.bz2~.  They will\nunpack into the ~data/~ subdirectory of the package and the code will expect to find them in\n~/usr/shared/libTheSky/~ by default.  Hence, to install the data files manually, do e.g.:\n  #+begin_src bash\n    tar xfj libthesky-data-<YYYYMMDD>.tar.bz2\n    sudo mkdir /usr/shared/libTheSky/\n    sudo cp -vi data/* /usr/shared/libTheSky/\n  #+end_src \nAlternatively, you can use the libTheSky_data target in the CMake file of the source code,\nby copying the data files into that package's subdirectory before compiling it, and making\nsure you install the data files as well:\n  #+begin_src bash\n    tar xfz libthesky-<0.0.1>.tar.gz\n    tar xfj libthesky-data-<YYYYMMDD>.tar.bz2\n    mv data libthesky-0.0.1/\n    cd libthesky-0.0.1/\n    ...\n    sudo make libTheSky_data install\n  #+end_src \nAll data files needed to use libTheSky are provided in the tarball.  The file ~asteroids.dat~ is a reduced\nversion of the file https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz, containing all bodies with H<15 and a<100\nAU (~25% of total, ~90,000 objects).  If you want to use the full/latest version instead, do something like:\n  #+begin_src bash\n  .$ wget https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/dat/ELEMENTS.NUMBR.gz -O - | gunzip -c > data/asteroids.dat\n  #+end_src \nThis is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the European Union Public\nLicence 1.2 (EUPL 1.2).
