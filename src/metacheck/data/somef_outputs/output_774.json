conda-forge\"\n/>\n</a>\n\n![alt-text](https://github.com/btozer/gmg/blob/add_vgg/gmg_demo.gif)\n\nStatement of need\n=================\n\nGMG is an open-source Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed principally for modelling\n2D potential field (gravity and magnetic) profiles. The software also includes \nfunctions for loading XY data, seismic reflection SEGY data and exploration well horizons.\nThe software therefore provides an integrated geological/geophysical interpretation\npackage. It is anticipated that GMG will also be useful for teaching purposes.\n\nData I/O is made as simple as possible using space delimited ASCII text files.\n\nThe project was instigated after failing to find an adequate open-source option\n(in which the source code can be viewed and modified by the user) for performing 2D \ngeophysical modeling tasks. Inspiration came from [Fatiando a Terra](https://www.fatiando.org/) and [GMT](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/).\n\n**NB: GMG is in development. Some documentation is incomplete and some features may not work as expected. If you experience any issues, please feel free to raise these on the issue tracker.**\n\nKey features\n------------\n\n* Import and display observed topography, gravity and magnetic 2D profile data.\n* Apply filters to observed data.\n* Add and manipulate model layers (subsurface bodies) using a simple interactive interface.\n* \u201cPinch out/snap\u201d layers against adjacent layers.\n* Calculate the predicted gravity anomaly produced by any combination of model layers.\n* Calculate the predicted magnetic anomaly produced by any combination of model layers.\n* Model magnetic anomalies using induced and/or remanent magnetism.\n* Display well horizon tops.\n* Display XY data (e.g., earthquake hypocenters, geological surface contacts or rays from a auxiliary velocity model).\n* Import and display seismic reflection data.\n* Export model data (e.g., predicted anomalies and layer geometries) as ASCII text files.\n* Save model figures as vector or raster graphics in various formats (.png .ps .eps .pdf).\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nPre-Installation\n----------------\n\n**Note** \n\ngmg is written in Python 3 and can be installed using common python package managers \nconda (from conda-forge) or pip. Installation and launching of the software involves \nthe use of a command line terminal, but this is minimal and should be manageable for a non-expert\nby following the instructions below. \n\n**Step 1: Install Miniforge**\n\nIf you don't already use miniforge or anaconda for managing and installing python packages, then \nthe simplest way to install gmg is to first install Miniforge (a minimal installer for [Conda](http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)\nspecifically for [conda-forge](http://conda-forge.org)).\n\nThis should ensure you can install all the dependencies required on any platform (Linux, Mac, Windows) using the Conda\npackage manager.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new conda environment for gmg**\n\nIt's best to create a new conda environment to use when running GMG. This will avoid any potential conflicts. e.g.:\n\n    conda create -n gmgpy\n\nWhere the -n flag dictates what you want to name the new environment (you can call the environment whatever you like\nbut the documentation will use the name gmg-env).\n\nOn macOS and Linux this environment can then be activated using:\n\n    conda activate gmgpy\n\nOr on Windows use::\n\n    activate gmgpy\n\nOnce the environment is activated any call to python will only \"see\" the packages install within the gmg-env\nenvironment. To deactivate the environment either close the terminal window or on macOS and Linux run:\n\n    conda deactivate\n\nOr on Windows use:\n\n    deactivate\n\n**OS Support:**\n\nGMG is currently only tested on macOS Monterey, Ubuntu 22.04 Linux and Windows 11 operating systems. It is possible\nthat issues may arise when trying to install on other distributions. Please raise any information regarding\ninstallation problems on github.\n\nInstalling gmg\n--------------\n\n**NB: conda-forge and pip packages are currently in development and not yet deployed**\n\nThe gmg package is hosted on both conda-forge and PyPi (pip). It is highly recommended that\nyou install gmg in a standalone conda environment using option 1 below. This is ensure\nyou do not create any dependencies issues that may arise if you install system-wide using pip.\n\nFirst, ensure your gmgpy conda environment is active. On macOS or Linux use:\n\n    source activate gmgpy\n\nOr on Windows use:\n\n    activate gmgpy\n\n**Installation option using pip test**\n\n    pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple gmgpy\n\nLaunching gmg\n-------------\n\nafter installation, make sure you are using a terminal with your gmgpy environment active \n(i.e., conda activate gmgpy), then, gmg can be launched from your terminal command line using:\n\n    gmgpy\n \nThe splash screen and gmg model shell should appear. You can now begin using the software.\n\nTutorial and demo data\n----------------------\n\nGMG is packaged with a tutorial dataset and benchmark demos. If you installed gmg using the recommended miniforge \napproach (as outlined above), then, the gmg package directory is likely located in a path similar to:\n    <pre>\n    /Users/<strong>username</strong>/miniforge3/envs/gmgpy/lib/python3.<strong>X</strong>/site-packages/gmgpy\n    </pre>\n\nWithin this directory are the two subdirectories:\n     \n     demos/\n     tutorial/ \n     \nThese can be copied or moved to another location on your system or accessed from gmgpy directory when required. \nYou can also download these directories from the gmg github docs/ directory. \n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nThe best way to get started is to read through the [Documentation](https://btozer.github.io/gmg/) starting with \nthe [Manual](https://btozer.github.io/gmg/html/manual.html) and \n[Demos](https://btozer.github.io/gmg/html/manual_benchmark_examples.html) then\nwork your way through the [Tutorial](https://btozer.github.io/gmg/html/tutorial.html). These can also be found \nby launching gmg and then navigating to:\n\n    Help -> Documentation\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nAny contribution, big or small is welcome. Examples include:\n\n1. Writing new code/functions.\n2. Improving the user interface.\n3. Submitting bug reports and spelling corrections.\n\nThey are all helpful!\n\n**Becoming a developer**\n\nThe best way to become a developer is to create a folk of the github repository. You can then send a pull request once you are satisfied you want to share your modifications.\n\n**Suggestions & bug reporting**\n\nThe best way to make a suggestion or open a bug report is to raise an issue on Github.\n\nPlease use the subject line:\n    \n    GMG suggestion: \"short suggestion description\"\n    GMG bug report: \"short bug description\"\n\nPlease include as much detail as possible when describing the bug.\n\nCiting\n------\n\nIf you use GMG, please cite this github repository.", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "<a href=\"https://btozer.github.io/gmg/\">Visit the GMG documentation page</a>"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://github.com/btozer/gmg/wiki", "format": "wiki"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/README.md"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/docs/build_doc.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/docs/icons/convert_icon_size.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/paper/compile.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/src/gmgpy/icons/convert_icon_size.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "commandline-application", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 0.82, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "logo": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/add_vgg/docs/_sources/_static/gmg_logo_white.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/btozer/gmg/master/README.md"}]}
