The easiest way to get that ID is with\n`find_team_contest()`, which returns the contest ID for all matches in a\nparticular season (using the Team ID provided by `find_team_id()`). For\ninstance, to find the contest ID for 2024 National Championship match\nbetween Louisville and Penn State:\n\n``` r\nfind_team_id(\"Penn St.\", 2024) |> \n  find_team_contests() |> \n  tail()\n```\n\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n| date       | team     | opponent       | result | attendance | contest |\n|:-----------|:---------|:---------------|:-------|-----------:|:--------|\n| 12/06/2024 | Penn St. | Delaware St.   | W 3-0  |       2516 | 6080734 |\n| 12/07/2024 | Penn St. | North Carolina | W 3-1  |       2470 | 6080733 |\n| 12/13/2024 | Penn St. | Marquette      | W 3-1  |       2914 | 6081048 |\n| 12/15/2024 | Penn St. | Creighton      | W 3-2  |       3558 | 6081042 |\n| 12/19/2024 | Penn St. | Nebraska       | W 3-2  |      21726 | 6080708 |\n| 12/22/2024 | Penn St. | Louisville     | W 3-1  |      21860 | 6080706 |\n\n</div>\n\nFrom that, we can see that the contest ID is 6080706. If we pass this\ncontest ID to the `player_match_stats()` function, we'll get a list with\ntwo data frames (one for each team in the contest) that contain player\nstatistics for the match. If we want to get just the Penn State player\ndata, we can set `team = \"Penn St.\"`.\n\n``` r\nplayer_match_stats(contest = \"6080706\", team = \"Penn St.\")\n```\n\n<div class=\"kable-table\">\n\n| Season | Date | ContestID | Team | Conference | Opponent Team | Opponent Conference | Location | Number | Player | P | S | Kills | Errors | TotalAttacks | HitPct | Assists | Aces | SErr | Digs | RetAtt | RErr | BlockSolos | BlockAssists | BErr | PTS | BHE |\n|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|---:|:---|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 2 | Ava Falduto | L/DS | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 14 | 24 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2.0 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 3 | Gillian Grimes | L/DS | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 | 7 | 1 | 3 | 16 | 23 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1.0 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 8 | Camryn Hannah | OH | 4 | 19 | 9 | 42 | 0.238 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 3 | 9 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 21.5 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 14 | Caroline Jurevicius | OH | 4 | 10 | 4 | 26 | 0.231 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 11.0 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 44 | Maggie Mendelson | MB | 4 | 6 | 1 | 14 | 0.357 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 9.5 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 24 | Quinn Menger | DS | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 9 | Jess Mruzik | OH | 4 | 29 | 6 | 73 | 0.315 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 14 | 22 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 33.0 | 1 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 11 | Jocelyn Nathan | L/DS | 4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 | 3 | 1 | 0 | 10 | 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1.0 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 21 | Izzy Starck | S | 4 | 0 | 2 | 7 | -0.286 | 55 | 1 | 3 | 13 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1.5 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | 1 | Taylor Trammell | MB | 4 | 8 | 1 | 15 | 0.467 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3 | 0 | 9.5 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | NA | TEAM |  | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.000 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0.0 | 0 |\n| 2024-2025 | 2024-12-22 | 6080706 | Penn St. | Big Ten | Louisville | ACC | Home | NA | Penn St. |  | 4 | 72 | 23 | 177 | 0.277 | 69 | 7 | 13 | 78 | 88 | 4 | 3 | 16 | 2 | 90.0 | 1 |\n\n</div>\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Match data", "parent_header": ["ncaavolleyballr <a href=\"https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/ncaavolleyballr/\"><img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"139\" alt=\"ncaavolleyballr website\" /></a>", "Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JeffreyRStevens/ncaavolleyballr/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"value": "Play-by-play data are also available with `match_pbp()`.
