(teetime-framework.github.io\r\n    version 3.0). Additional documentation will be added. Currently, the\r\n    TeeTime-based framework and filters exist in parallel to the\r\n    existing infrastructure. The long-term plan is that the\r\n    TeeTime-based infrastructure replaces the existing one.\r\n  - New file system writer to replace the existing ones in the next\r\n    Kieker release\r\n  - Generic file writer supporting different compression types\r\n  - Monitoring support for Spring-based REST communication with AspectJ\r\n  - Support for enums in IRL\r\n  - Support for additional compression algorithms in the file writers \r\n    and readers\r\n  - New TeeTime reader stages with common interface to use them in\r\n    tools\r\n  - Introduced new Kieker tool framework covering commandline and\r\n    configurations file evaluation (see Writing Tools and Services)\r\n  - Added monitoring of database calls (including the SQL statement)\r\n  - Introduced new data bridge tool, called collector\r\n  - Ensuring support for Java 7, 8, 9, and 10\r\n- Improvements and refactorings\r\n  - Moved the Kafka readers and writers into a separate Gradle module. \r\n    This is supposed to be a schematic example and other technology-specific \r\n    modules are to follow. The goal is to improve the dependency management.\r\n  - Many cleanups and improved test coverage\r\n  - Restructuring of sub-projects tools have now separate projects and\r\n    shared tool features can be found in kieker-tools\r\n- Infrastructure\r\n  - Included Clover test coverage tool, migrated from FindBugs to\r\n    SpotBugs\r\n  - Replacing Jar file dependencies to Maven Central dependencies\r\n    (ongoing)\r\n  - Switched to Jenkins declarative pipeline\r\n  - Updated the build system to provide separate bundles for all tools\r\n- Documentation\r\n  - Updated and new documentation are now located in the Kieker wiki\r\n    https://kieker-monitoring.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/overview\r\n- Bug fixes and improvements to code, performance, tests, documentation,\r\n  examples\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/tarball/1.14", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/zipball/1.14", "html_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/tag/1.14", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/26429638", "release_id": 26429638, "date_created": "2020-05-12T10:16:05Z", "date_published": "2020-05-13T06:56:16Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20661412", "name": "kieker-1.14-binaries.tar.gz", "content_size": 783800228, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-1.14-binaries.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/gzip", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T17:20:23Z", "download_count": 82}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20659823", "name": "kieker-1.14-binaries.zip", "content_size": 784465577, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-1.14-binaries.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T16:28:05Z", "download_count": 230}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20658159", "name": "kieker-1.14-javadoc.jar", "content_size": 7829696, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-1.14-javadoc.jar", "encoding_format": "application/x-java-archive", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T15:35:40Z", "download_count": 44}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20658136", "name": "kieker-1.14-sources.jar", "content_size": 1595773, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-1.14-sources.jar", "encoding_format": "application/x-java-archive", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T15:35:06Z", "download_count": 12}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20659292", "name": "kieker-1.14-sources.tar.gz", "content_size": 151167770, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-1.14-sources.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/gzip", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T16:08:56Z", "download_count": 23}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20658211", "name": "kieker-1.14-sources.zip", "content_size": 153694931, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-1.14-sources.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T15:37:44Z", "download_count": 81}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20658197", "name": "kieker-userguide.pdf", "content_size": 2001904, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/kieker-userguide.pdf", "encoding_format": "application/pdf", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T15:37:11Z", "download_count": 671}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20663010", "name": "md5sums.txt", "content_size": 635, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/md5sums.txt", "encoding_format": "text/plain", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T18:12:43Z", "download_count": 10}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/assets/20663009", "name": "README", "content_size": 12842, "content_url": "https://github.com/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/download/1.14/README", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2020-05-12T18:12:42Z", "download_count": 16}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/kieker-monitoring/kieker/releases/8002013", "tag": "1.13", "name": "Kieker 1.13", "author": {"name": "avanhoorn", "type": "User"}, "description": "Release Notes\r\n\r\n- New features (selection)\r\n  -
