By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.

It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n", "type": "File_dump", "name": "GNU Affero General Public License v3.0", "spdx_id": "AGPL-3.0"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabftw/master/LICENSE"}, {"result": {"value": "AGPL-3.0", "type": "License"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabftw/master/package.json"}, {"result": {"value": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/blob/master/LICENSE", "type": "License", "identifier": "https://spdx.org/licenses/https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/blob/master/LICENSE", "spdx_id": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/blob/master/LICENSE"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabftw/master/codemeta.json"}], "description": [{"result": {"value": ":notebook: eLabFTW is the most popular open source electronic lab notebook for research labs.", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "Laboratory notebook for research labs", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabftw/master/composer.json"}, {"result": {"value": "Free and open source electronic lab notebook for research labs", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabftw/master/package.json"}, {"result": {"value": "A free and open source electronic laboratory notebook for research labs.", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elabftw/elabftw/master/codemeta.json"}, {"result": {"value": "**eLabFTW** is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams.\n\nIt lets you store and organize your research experiments easily.

Metadata XML (/metadata.php), a change has recently been made\r\n  to use the user defined attributes, instead of hardcoding them. But in\r\n  some case, the value was empty, not null, but an empty string, so the\r\n  Name attribute would be empty, and Shibboleth software that regularly\r\n  parses SP metadata would choke on it and everything would explode.\r\n\r\n  This change prevents having an empty Name attribute for the requested\r\n  attributes in SP metadata.\r\n\r\n* bug/medium: saml: user identity attributes update during saml\r\n\r\n  When using SAML auth, if the parameter \"Allow users to change their\r\n  first name, last name, or email address\" was inactive (not default),\r\n  then the user would encounter an error because the app would try and\r\n  update the user but have no right to do so.\r\n\r\n  This is fixed by making the update() method of Users public and using it\r\n  for trusted calls, and moving this check into the patch() method.\r\n\r\n* bug/medium: fix a bug preventing custom ``MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`` or ``MAX_UPLOAD_TIME`` to be set (fix #5232)\r\n* bug/minor: fix save button from

never be a good time to release a stable version. There is always one last feature that should be added, or a little bug found right before tagging.\r\n\r\nSo here it is. It might not be perfect, but at least it's there and everyone can move on from 5.0.4, released many moons ago.\r\n\r\nThere will obviously be patch releases following this one, so make sure to also update to them once they are out.\r\n\r\nThis version contains a lot of changes, but nothing particular when it comes to upgrading. Just upgrade as usual.\r\n\r\nSee [blog post](https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-50100/). See full changelog below.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Version 5.1.0 changes\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy changes\r\n\r\n* Authentication cookies will now be set for users logged with SAML if the instance configuration allows for setting them. Previously, SAML authenticated user would be logged out after closing the browser, now they will have cookies to stay logged in, but only if the instance configuration allows them. (PR #5136 fix #5135). See settings in Security tab of Sysconfig panel.\r\n* Improvements with .eln files: .eln archives can now contain a mix of experiments, resources or templates. Exporting an entry in .eln will also include any link they have, and the link of the links too. Importing a .eln will correctly create all entries, too, and honor the links. See new API endpoints `api/v2/exports` and `api/v2/import`.\r\n* Audit event emitted in PHP logs is now a JSON string\r\n\r\n## Breaking API v2 changes\r\n\r\n* `/team_tags` has moved to `teams/{id}/tags`. If you have scripts using `/team_tags`, replace it with `teams/current/tags` to get the same behaviour.\r\n* The POST action for Revisions endpoint has been removed. Revisions are created by changing the entry content, so it doesn't make sense to expose this action publicly.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Rework of the Import and Export functions (PR #5123): new pages Import and Export in the Profile, asynchronous Export function\r\n* See documentation for [Import/Export](https://doc.elabftw.net/import-export.html)\r\n* Addition of exclusive edit mode (PR #5127 by @MarcelBolten): allow users to open entries in exclusive edit mode, preventing changes from other users\r\n* Add signatures: [see dedicated section on blog](https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-50100/#signature-action)\r\n* Add action requests: [see dedicated section on blog](https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-50100/#requesting-action)\r\n* Add procurement requests (beta)\r\n* Add onboarding emails (PR #5029 by @MarcelBolten): Allow sending onboarding emails to new users, with a generic template but also a team specific template. And another for sys/admins.\r\n* Allow control of client side upload timeout with `MAX_UPLOAD_TIME` env var (PR #5138, fix #5134)\r\n* New CLI command: `bin/console teams:export X` to export a full team in a .eln\r\n* New CLI command: `bin/console teams:import` to import a full team from a .eln\r\n* List attachments: the profile now contains a tab that will list all the attached files from user. See also new endpoint `api/v2/users/me/uploads/`.\r\n* Allow uploading files on experiment templates (PR #5068)\r\n* Allow duplicating files when duplicating an entry\r\n* Add `uploads_filesize_sum` and `uploads_filesize_sum_formatted` to `/api/v2/info` endpoint\r\n* Add Archive button for batch action\r\n* Add emoticons to text editor (PR #5025 by @MarcelBolten)\r\n* New Batch tab in Admin panel to execute actions on entire sets of entries (PR #5148)\r\n* Add Sysconfig setting to select mass email behavior (grouped or not) (PR #5206 fix #4781)\r\n* Add Sysconfig setting to prevent users from changing their identity (firstname, lastname and email) (PR #5202)\r\n* Display statistics about uploaded files on Sysconfig page (on tab Uploads)\r\n* Allow Admins to filter users by team\r\n* Support adding media files via upload dropdown menu (PR #5189 by Alexander Minges)\r\n* Add media menu to editor (PR #5188 by Alexander Minges)\r\n* Add support for listening to uploaded audio files directly in the browser\r\n* Use a modal window with export settings on export action\r\n* Allow removing text from QR Code PNG export\r\n* Add config option for ldap scheme (see  https://github.com/DirectoryTree/LdapRecord/issues/732)\r\n* Add ID in view mode too\r\n* Add support for defining an xml URL with IDP list to populate IDPs from that list, with an auto-update mechanism (PR #5184)\r\n* Regroup Local authentication settings into a new \"Local auth\" tab on Sysconfig panel. Allow disabling completely local auth (fix #5212 - PR #5216)\r\n* Add a CSV report button in Admin panel, similar to what the sysadmin has already\r\n* Resources categories (aka `items_types`) now properly honor the permissions, which makes them shareable across teams. Previously they were limited to the team that created them. (fix #5162 via PR #5220)\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Allow uploading very big files (> 3 Gb) on S3: increase part size for multipart uploads (PR #5137 fix #5133)\r\n* Update the `orgid` value for users after SAML login, with the value from IDP (PR #5139)\r\n* ELN export: add name and description to the `./` node\r\n* On user creation after SAML login, create the user with the `orgid` (PR #5048 by Lauritz Bussfeld)\r\n* Use nameid in SAML SLO request (#PR 5077 fix #4964)\r\n* Open attachments in new tab\r\n* Improvements for links (PR #5073): allow links to experiments on experiments templates\r\n* Allow control of changelog regardless of PDF/A setting (PR #5072 by @anargam, fix #4969)\r\n* Add related links in edit mode too (even if they cannot be edited)\r\n* Allow user without a team to select a team upon login (PR #5060)\r\n* Add Status to autocomplete in links (PR #5064)\r\n* Add archived users to report (PR #5044 by @MarcelBolten)\r\n* Fix images in PDFs (PR #5036 by @MarcelBolten, fix #4961)\r\n* Bring back the reset 2FA button from Sys/Admin panels\r\n* Add the upload id and a link to its json in \"More information\" uploaded file section\r\n* Add note on how to deselect a selected entry in multi select on perm modal. fix #5175\r\n* Merge extra fields being loaded with \"Load fields\" button instead of overwrite everything (see #3214)\r\n* Use the SAML provided firstname/lastname to update user attributes upon SAML login (see #4513)\r\n* Make the Save icon of the TinyMCE toolbar more visible by moving it as first icon, and using a floppy disk icon\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Fix bug where forced use of MFA would prevent changing email in user panel\r\n* Fix bug where filtering on top of Related filter would break\r\n* Fix action button to set the time/date to now not working outside edit page\r\n* Fix improper initialization of experimentsLinks for itemsTypes\r\n* Fix Mathjax in PDF/A (#5028)\r\n* Replace incorrect term `status` by `categories` in `experiments_categories` section of api description (PR #5012 by @mhxion, fix #5011)\r\n* Honor idp settings for attributes in metadata.xml (fix #5145)\r\n* Fix missing update of `lastchangeby` when a submodel (_i.e._ steps) has been modified\r\n* Fix editor not matching `content_type` (markdown or html) if user setting is different\r\n* Fix templates being created with incorrect `content_type` (fix #5190)\r\n* Fix bug where duplicating a template would not duplicate links\r\n* Fix URL in pdf footer (fix #5173)\r\n* Fix bug where deduplicating a tag would impact tags in other teams with the same tag value (fix #5215)\r\n* Fix confusing behavior with permissions set to Teams and users belonging in the same Team\r\n* Fix extra fields links to experiments/resources/users not showing name/title in toggle body (fix #5180)\r\n\r\n## Dev stuff\r\n\r\n* Add a fixed firstname to users created with the populate script\r\n* Improvements by anargam regarding Content-Type of user uploaded content, and user validation logic\r\n* Fix composer shadow dependencies (PR #5061)\r\n* Use PER Coding Style 2.0\r\n* Upgrade Jquery-UI to v14, now without IE support <3\r\n* As always, many refactors and improvements in the codebase, that are not particularly useful to list exhaustively here.\r\n* Removed the default resource category when a new team is created\r\n* Many, many code refactoring and changes, as with all major releases!", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/5.1.0", "zipball_url":

Alpha release, not for production!\r\n\r\nThe changelog below is incomplete. This tagged release is for testing and preview purposes only, it's missing some polishing here and there but should work fine globally. It has been deployed on the demo already.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n\r\n## Version 5.1.0\r\n\r\n\r\n### Noteworthy changes\r\n\r\n* Authentication cookies will now be set for users logged with SAML if the instance configuration allows for setting them. Previously, SAML authenticated user would be logged out after closing the browser, now they will have cookies to stay logged in, but only if the instance configuration allows them. (PR #5136 fix #5135). See settings in Security tab of Sysconfig panel.\r\n* Improvements with .eln files: .eln archives can now contain a mix of experiments, resources or templates. Exporting an entry in .eln will also include any link they have, and the link of the links too. Importing a .eln will correctly create all entries, too, and honor the links. See new API endpoints `api/v2/exports` and `api/v2/import`.\r\n* Audit event emitted in PHP logs is now a JSON string\r\n\r\n### Breaking API v2 changes\r\n\r\n* `/team_tags` has moved to `teams/{id}/tags`. If you have scripts using `/team_tags`, replace it with `teams/current/tags` to get the same behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* Rework of the Import and Export functions (PR #5123): new pages Import and Export in the Profile, asynchronous Export function\r\n* See documentation for :ref:`Import <importing-data>`\r\n* See documentation for :ref:`Export <exporting-data>`\r\n* Addition of exclusive edit mode (PR #5127 by Marcel Bolten): allow users to open entries in exclusive edit mode, preventing changes from other users\r\n* Add signatures: see dedicated section on blog: TODO\r\n* Add action requests: see dedicated section on blog: TODO\r\n* Add procurement requests: see dedicated section on blog: TODO\r\n* Add onboarding emails (PR #5029 by Marcel Bolten): Allow sending onboarding emails to new users, with a generic template but also a team specific template. And another for sys/admins.\r\n* Allow control of client side upload timeout with `MAX_UPLOAD_TIME` env var (PR #5138, fix #5134)\r\n* New CLI command: `bin/console teams:export X` to export a full team in a .eln\r\n* New CLI command: `bin/console teams:import` to import a full team from a .eln\r\n* List attachments: the profile now contains a tab that will list all the attached files from user. See also new endpoint `api/v2/users/me/uploads/`.\r\n* Allow uploading files on experiment templates (PR #5068)\r\n* Allow duplicating files when duplicating an entry\r\n* Add `uploads_filesize_sum` and `uploads_filesize_sum_formatted` to `/api/v2/info` endpoint\r\n* Add Archive button for batch action\r\n* Add emoticons to text editor (PR #5025 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* New Batch tab in Admin panel to execute actions on entire sets of entries (PR #5148)\r\n\r\n### Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Allow uploading very big files (> 3 Gb) on S3: increase part size for multipart uploads (PR #5137 fix #5133)\r\n* Update the `orgid` value for users after SAML login, with the value from IDP (PR #5139)\r\n* ELN export: add name and description to the `./` node\r\n* On user creation after SAML login, create the user with the `orgid` (PR #5048 by Lauritz Bussfeld)\r\n* Use nameid in SAML SLO request (#PR 5077 fix #4964)\r\n* Open attachments in new tab\r\n* Improvements for links (PR #5073): allow links to experiments on experiments templates\r\n* Allow control of changelog regardless of PDF/A setting (PR #5072 by anargam, fix #4969)\r\n* Add related links in edit mode too (even if they cannot be edited)\r\n* Allow user without a team to select a team upon login (PR #5060)\r\n* Add Status to autocomplete in links (PR #5064)\r\n* Add archived users to report (PR #5044 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Fix images in PDFs (PR #5036 by Marcel Bolten, fix #4961)\r\n* Bring back the reset 2FA button from Sys/Admin panels\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Fix bug where forced use of MFA would prevent changing email in user panel\r\n* Fix bug where filtering on top of Related filter would break\r\n* Fix action button to set the time/date to now not working outside edit page\r\n* Fix improper initialization of experimentsLinks for itemsTypes\r\n* Fix Mathjax in PDF/A (#5028)\r\n* Replace incorrect term `status` by `categories` in `experiments_categories` section of api description (PR #5012 by @mhxion, fix #5011)\r\n* Honor idp settings for attributes in metadata.xml (fix #5145)\r\n\r\n### Dev stuff\r\n\r\n* Add a fixed firstname to users created with the populate script\r\n* Improvements by anargam regarding Content-Type of user uploaded content, and user validation logic\r\n* Fix composer shadow dependencies (PR #5061)\r\n* Use PER Coding Style 2.0\r\n* As always, many refactors and improvements in the codebase, that are not particularly useful to list exhaustively here.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/5.1.0-alpha", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/5.1.0-alpha", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/5.1.0-alpha", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/165860454", "release_id": 165860454, "date_created": "2024-07-17T14:06:24Z", "date_published": "2024-07-17T14:09:35Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/148039840", "tag": "5.0.4", "name": "elabftw-5.0.4", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Version 5.0.4\r\n\r\n\r\nBugfix patch:\r\n\r\n* use max-height:100% in body_view. fix issue #5003\r\n* fix profile statistics and team groups (#4963)\r\n* fix query example in api doc (#5002)\r\n* fix issue with month long bookings in scheduler (#4991)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/5.0.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/5.0.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/5.0.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/148039840", "release_id": 148039840, "date_created": "2024-03-23T10:32:32Z", "date_published": "2024-03-23T10:36:45Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/145548270", "tag": "5.0.3", "name": "elabftw-5.0.3", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Version 5.0.3\r\n\r\n\r\nSmall bugfix patch (#4968).\r\n\r\n* fix issue where an entry could not be accessed in edit mode if these two conditions were true:\r\n\r\n  -

Please read the Noteworthy changes below.\r\n\r\n## Breaking change\r\n\r\nThe reason for major version bump: APIv1 is removed and will display an error message, that cannot be bypassed anymore.\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy changes\r\n\r\n* The ability to disable the \"Delete\" button and deletion of entries by users have been removed. These settings were added before the addition of a \"soft-delete\" mechanism. Currently, when something is Deleted, the data is marked as being deleted, but is still present in the sql database (and can be restored easily). The disabled button resulted in bad user experience so it is now always available.\r\n* The default memory limit for PHP has been raised from 256 Mo to 2 Gb. This has no impact if you already defined it with the env var ``MAX_PHP_MEMORY``. This will have an impact if you don't have 2 Gb of memory to allocate. In that case, set that parameter to a more fitting value.\r\n* The way pagination works has changed, you now have a button to \"Load more\". This means that now the \"limit\" parameter is correctly respected, returning 10 entries if the limit is 10, not 11 as before. This might impact you if you have scripts expecting the old behavior.\r\n* The escaping strategy has been changed from sanitizing input to escaping output thanks to the amazing work done by Marcel Bolten in PR #4835. This should fix issue with quotes appearing wrongly from time to time.\r\n* ``metadata`` field in JSON output is now interpreted (no longer a string)\r\n* The experiments are no longer shared across teams if the owner belongs to multiple teams. See complete description of the behavior: https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4908 (PR #4920 fix #4894)\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Add \"Custom ID\" attribute to entities (see #3724)\r\n* Allow deleting links pointing to an entry, from the entry (fix #4738)\r\n* The \"Create\" button now displays Experiments Templates in a modal window before creating an experiment\r\n* Allow an Admin to add an existing user to their team (PR #4745). This behavior is disabled by default. A new Sysconfig setting has been added to control it.\r\n* Display Status list on Dashboard (fix #4715)\r\n* Allow transfer ownership of experiments\r\n* Add a new set of read/write permissions to experiments templates and resources categories. Now there is one for the template itself and one for the resulting entry created from it. (#4820)\r\n* Add a new \"Scope\" button to easily switch the range of things you want listed: yours only, including your team, or everything you have access to (PR #4812)\r\n* Add ``tcl``, ``diff`` and ``vhdl`` to syntax highlighting\r\n* Add ``bin/console uploads:check`` command to add hash and or filesize to all files\r\n* Display the id of timestamped experiments in verbose mode with ``bin/console experiments:timestamp``\r\n* Allow changing the language without being logged in (PR #4850)\r\n* Add an \"Audit logs\" section in Sysconfig panel to display actions such as users login in/out, users to teams modifications, password changes, etc...\r\n* Add instance parameter to export audit logs to web server error log\r\n* Add instance parameter to prevent Admins from archiving users (fix #4866)\r\n* When a user logs in, a notification is added if the eLabFTW instance has been upgraded since the last time they logged in.

:tada: \r\n\r\n113 days after the release of 4.9.0, here is the much anticipated 5.0.0 with a plethora of new features, enhancements and bugfixes!\r\n\r\nYes, this is a major version bump, but apart from the removal of REST API Version 1, there are no other breaking changes, so the upgrade has nothing in particular. Please read the Noteworthy changes below.\r\n\r\n## Breaking change\r\n\r\nThe reason for major version bump: APIv1 is removed and will display an error message, that cannot be bypassed anymore.\r\n\r\n## Noteworthy changes\r\n\r\n* The ability to disable the \"Delete\" button and deletion of entries by users have been removed. These settings were added before the addition of a \"soft-delete\" mechanism. Currently, when something is Deleted, the data is marked as being deleted, but is still present in the sql database (and can be restored easily). The disabled button resulted in bad user experience so it is now always available.\r\n* The default memory limit for PHP has been raised from 256 Mo to 2 Gb. This has no impact if you already defined it with the env var ``MAX_PHP_MEMORY``. This will have an impact if you don't have 2 Gb of memory to allocate. In that case, set that parameter to a more fitting value.\r\n* The way pagination works has changed, you now have a button to \"Load more\". This means that now the \"limit\" parameter is correctly respected, returning 10 entries if the limit is 10, not 11 as before. This might impact you if you have scripts expecting the old behavior.\r\n* The escaping strategy has been changed from sanitizing input to escaping output thanks to the amazing work done by Marcel Bolten in PR #4835. This should fix issue with quotes appearing wrongly from time to time.\r\n* ``metadata`` field in JSON output is now interpreted (no longer a string)\r\n* The experiments are no longer shared across teams if the owner belongs to multiple teams. See complete description of the behavior: https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4908 (PR #4920 fix #4894)\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Add \"Custom ID\" attribute to entities (see #3724)\r\n* Allow deleting links pointing to an entry, from the entry (fix #4738)\r\n* The \"Create\" button now displays Experiments Templates in a modal window before creating an experiment\r\n* Allow an Admin to add an existing user to their team (PR #4745). This behavior is disabled by default. A new Sysconfig setting has been added to control it.\r\n* Display Status list on Dashboard (fix #4715)\r\n* Allow transfer ownership of experiments\r\n* Add a new set of read/write permissions to experiments templates and resources categories. Now there is one for the template itself and one for the resulting entry created from it. (#4820)\r\n* Add a new \"Scope\" button to easily switch the range of things you want listed: yours only, including your team, or everything you have access to (PR #4812)\r\n* Add ``tcl``, ``diff`` and ``vhdl`` to syntax highlighting\r\n* Add ``bin/console uploads:check`` command to add hash and or filesize to all files\r\n* Display the id of timestamped experiments in verbose mode with ``bin/console experiments:timestamp``\r\n* Allow changing the language without being logged in (PR #4850)\r\n* Add an \"Audit logs\" section in Sysconfig panel to display actions such as users login in/out, users to teams modifications, password changes, etc...\r\n* Add instance parameter to export audit logs to web server error log\r\n* Add instance parameter to prevent Admins from archiving users (fix #4866)\r\n* When a user logs in, a notification is added if the eLabFTW instance has been upgraded since the last time they logged in. This notification is web only, no email, and points to the blog post with new features.\r\n* Add instance parameter to configure the link to the Chat room in the help menu. Useful if you have your own internal chat system.\r\n* Add a filtering input on top of templates listing to filter out results\r\n* Add account expiration notifications (#4886). New notifications:send-expiration command that executes every week and send an email to users with account expiring in the next 30 days and their Admins with a list of users expiring.\r\n* Add password policy tools (minimum length + complexity)\r\n* Set default password minimum length to 12 characters\r\n* Greatly improve extra fields search on search page (PR #4731 by Marcel)\r\n* Add `custom_id` to search query syntax (#4898 by Marcel)\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Add \"Admin\" text on teams where user is Admin in Sys/Admin Panel when listing users (fix #4740)\r\n* Archiving a user now gives the choice to also Archive/Lock their experiments (default to No)\r\n* Archive action no longer automatically locks and archive experiments\r\n* When adding tags, keep focus on the input element after addition\r\n* Modify \"Search term\" to \"Search user\" in remote directory search interface\r\n* Display categories everywhere, make Status appear different than categories and more aesthetic changes (PR #4720)\r\n* Allow deletion of a timestamped experiment\r\n* Allow \"caption\" html tag in body (used by tinymce for table title)\r\n* Remove the \"Anonymous visitors can see database items\" Team setting (fix #4663)\r\n* Make the \"Return to top\" button appear after one vertical height scroll (fix #4076)\r\n* Improve thumbnail generation: consume less memory and avoid issues with some PDFs (PR #4711 by Nico and Marcel)\r\n* Set the default ordering by last modified instead of date\r\n* Add steps related events to changelog\r\n* Add a button to display allowed email domains on register page (prevents issue with very long list)\r\n* Display multiple values in extra fields on several lines\r\n* Bring back the even/odd background color in tables\r\n* Order tags alphabetically\r\n* Add YAML to list of code languages\r\n* Keep the cursor at the same spot when selecting an entry in show mode (PR #4824 by Marcel)\r\n* Add a modal window before the blockchain timestamp action. Rework the text, too.\r\n* Add a close button to favorite tags and todolist panels.\r\n* Display more suggested tags and set them in a collapsible box\r\n* Add Category and Status to pdf export\r\n* Use JSON data to timestamp instead of PDF/A (fix #4757 via PR #4830)\r\n* Add Custom ID to link autocomplete\r\n* Increase timestamp timeout to 30 seconds\r\n* Add ``includeArchived`` to query string for users api endpoint (fix #4815)\r\n* Stop entries from jumping around upon selection in show mode (#4824 by Marcel)\r\n* Allow repositioning extra fields by dragging them (PR #4851)\r\n* Better CSV export with more columns (category, status, tags, colors, custom_id)\r\n* `limit` query parameter now correctly honored (was returning `limit + 1` before)\r\n* UI/UX fixes (PR #4833 by Marcel)\r\n* Always display main text + extra fields in toggle body in show mode\r\n* Improved .eln import/export with more fields taken into account such as Status and Category\r\n* Prevent the text editor (Tiny) from transforming a #word in title\r\n* Add informative message to explain the purpose of ``is_owner`` parameter\r\n* Add full export menu to templates\r\n* Improve API specification\r\n* The extra fields of type Experiments, Resources, or Users are now only storing the ID, so their value is a number, not a string anymore (fix #3857)\r\n* Create link automatically upon addition of extra field link (see #3857)\r\n* Make images fit screen at all times (fix #4418)\r\n\r\n## i18n\r\n\r\n* Fix missing translated strings in interface\r\n* Add Czech language (#4749, thanks to Ondrej Kuda

5.0.0-alpha\r\n\r\n## WARNING :: ALPHA Version\r\n\r\nThis release is tagged as ALPHA, meaning it is a preview release, not for production use.\r\n\r\nA blog post showing the new features is already available here: https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-500/\r\n\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nYes, this is a major version bump, but apart from the removal of REST API Version 1, there are no other major changes, so the upgrade has nothing in particular.\r\n\r\n## Breaking change\r\n\r\nThe reason for major version bump: APIv1 is removed and will display an error message, that cannot be bypassed anymore.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Add \"Custom ID\" attribute to entities (see #3724)\r\n* Allow deleting links pointing to an entry, from the entry (fix #4738)\r\n* The \"Create\" button now displays Experiments Templates in a modal window before creating an experiment\r\n* Allow an Admin to add an existing user to their team (PR #4745). This behavior is disabled by default. A new Sysconfig setting has been added to control it.\r\n* Display Status list on Dashboard (fix #4715)\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Add \"Admin\" text on teams where user is Admin in Sys/Admin Panel when listing users (fix #4740)\r\n* Archiving a user now gives the choice to also Archive/Lock their experiments (default to No)\r\n* Archive action no longer automatically locks and archive experiments\r\n* When adding tags, keep focus on the input element after addition\r\n* Modify \"Search term\" to \"Search user\" in remote directory search interface\r\n* Display categories everywhere, make Status appear different than categories and more aesthetic changes (PR #4720)\r\n* Allow deletion of a timestamped experiment\r\n* Allow \"caption\" html tag in body (used by tinymce for table title)\r\n* Remove the \"Anonymous visitors can see database items\" Team setting (fix #4663)\r\n* Make the \"Return to top\" button appear after one vertical height scroll (fix #4076)\r\n* Improve thumbnail generation: consume less memory and avoid issues with some PDFs (PR #4711 by Nico and Marcel)\r\n\r\n## i18n\r\n\r\n* Fix missing translated strings in interface\r\n* Add Czech language (#4749, thanks to Ondrej Kuda @ondrej-kuda for help with the translation)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Fix items_types api spec (fix #4696)\r\n\r\n## Dev corner\r\n\r\n* Use yarn berry with PnP (see PR #4698)\r\n* Use upstream OVE instead of our UMD building repo\r\n* Update TinyMCE to v6, imagetools plugin is no more, but new plugins are added, such as auto URL or accordion\r\n* Update Chemdoodle and change how it is imported/used\r\n* Use peggy cli to generate script (PR #4746 by Marcel)\r\n* Fix round edges on button (PR #4744, #4742 by Marcel)\r\n* Improve code of yarn plugin to copy the tinymce files (PR #4713 by Marcel)\r\n* Fix issue with Storage/Memory (PR #4674 by Marcel)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/5.0.0-alpha", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/5.0.0-alpha", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/5.0.0-alpha", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/130646595", "release_id": 130646595, "date_created": "2023-11-21T11:42:24Z", "date_published": "2023-11-21T11:45:03Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/127001975", "tag": "4.9.0", "name": "elabftw-4.9.0", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "# Version 4.9.0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking change\r\n\r\nThis release contains a breaking change for users of APIv1: the response will be an error unless `apiv1_is_dead` query string is added. APIv1 support will be completely dropped in 5.0 (likely the next major version). See https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4653 for more information.\r\n\r\n## Deprecation\r\n\r\nThe format of API keys has slightly changed to work around a design issue (fix #4617). Currently the change is backward compatible, meaning that existing keys will continue to work. It is recommended to generate a new key for faster response times especially if you're not Sysadmin. Old keys with previous format are now deprecated and need to be regenerated before 5.0.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Rework of Category and Status for Experiments and Resources (see blog post: https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-490/) (PR #4614) (see discussion: https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/discussions/4613)\r\n* Api keys now show a \"Last used\" timestamp, so their use is recorded and it becomes easy to see if the keys are in use or can be deleted\r\n* Add possibility for a Sysadmin to disable 2FA for a user (fix #4486 via #4646)\r\n* Allow the preview of Markdown and Json attachments (PR #4042 by Marcel and Nico)\r\n* Add JSON in highlighted languages selection list\r\n* Allow linking to experiment/resource/user from Extra fields (fix #3857 via PR #4616)\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Flatten the `mentions` and `comments` fields in .eln export\r\n* Title can be easily edited from view mode now\r\n* Add `/healthcheck.php` page to check if all is alright. Other monitoring endpoints (`/nginx-status`, `/php-status`, `/healthcheck`) were not checking the MySQL access, this one does.\r\n* Add categories to dashboard\r\n* Force inclusion of attachment files for PDF/A\r\n* Make team selection dynamic on team select page after saml login\r\n* Make search page help translatable and fix untranslated strings (fix #4659)\r\n* Add missing `metadata` column on `items_types` and rename to Resources categories\r\n* Allow browser to pass cookies when requesting webapp manifest (PR #4691 by @anargam)\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes\r\n\r\n* Fix bug where booking slots could appear bound to entries (fix #4654)\r\n* Fix bugs on Team page when no Resources is bookable\r\n* Fix deadline notifications for Steps\r\n* Fix incorrect redirect with Saml auth to selected page (fix #4649)\r\n* Fix Cancel button in 2FA setup page\r\n* Fallback to configured instance storage param if no storage param is present (fix #4615)\r\n* Fix bug where it was not possible to edit a booking slot if max number of slot was reached (fix #4679)\r\n* Fix bug where extra field would stay readonly when readonly property is present and false (fix #4693)\r\n* Fix fatal error when metadata is incorrect (see #4694)\r\n\r\n## Dev corner\r\n\r\n* Remove APIv1 test code\r\n* Fix test coverage results with correct merge between suites (PR #4655 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Improve code for toggle pin buttons (#4623 by Marcel and Nico)\r\n* Substitute some multiple whitespaces with single whitespace (#4622 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Improve spacing on Dashboard (#4621 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Populate action now uses tags that make sense instead of the generated ones (#4619)\r\n* Add TwigCS to CI pipelines (#4595 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n", "tarball_url":

finally here! Update to this version should be smooth. No crazy things happening in the mysql side like with 4.3 requiring MySQL 8.0.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\nGeneral note: updating to 4.4.0 from 4.3.0 should not cause any issue during the db:update step. It is highly recommended to update to this version so users can benefit from the bugfixes and new features.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes:\r\n\r\n* Users that use Markdown syntax will have all their experiments labelled as markdown for \"content_type\" (the rest is labelled \"html\"). So they might have an issue with experiments that they own that are not in markdown. In that case, they can fix it by going in edit mode of the experiment, clicking the top right menu (three vertical dots) and selecting \"Switch editor\" two times. Then save the experiment.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes:\r\n\r\n* Fix hidden teams not showing up in Add team menu\r\n* Fix mass email from team page using user's email/name instead of the instance's\r\n* Don't restrict image size in body (fix #3800)\r\n* Fix incorrect semver comparison in Sysconfig Panel\r\n* Fix event deletion notification settings not honored\r\n* Fix filename download with non-ascii paramaters\r\n* Fix filename upon save after displaying it (fix #3797)\r\n* Remove deadline when finishing a step\r\n* Fix date parsing in APIv1\r\n* Fix displaying revisions requiring write access instead of read access (see #2304)\r\n* Fix codesample plugin of tinymce clashing with prismjs (fix #3712)\r\n* Fix bug where user would end up without a team after login through saml/ldap and auth service sends team information and team is created at that moment\r\n* Fix bug where the extra fields defined in metadata would appear duplicated after save of the json code\r\n\r\n## Enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Add currently logged in team in user menu\r\n* Display number of timestamps over the past 30 days on Sysconfig Panel\r\n* Add a new \"Sort\" menu in show mode with human readable labels\r\n* Prevent browser autompletion on Team page of Sysconfig Panel\r\n* Allow toggling pin mode in edit and show modes\r\n* Visually separate tags in pdf export\r\n* Add more columns to CSV scheduler export\r\n* Make \"Full syntax\" link on search page appear like a link\r\n* Improve user interface in UCP > Account\r\n* Set the default behavior to \"Select team\" for SAML/LDAP login\r\n* Use urlencode on password of smtp to avoid issues with special chars (fix #3748)\r\n* Import metadata column of CSV as metadata (fix #3055)\r\n* Force including attached files in timestamp pdf (fix #3729 via #3732)\r\n* Add toggle body button to links\r\n* Display 2FA status and userid of users as badges when listing them in Admin or Sysconfig panels\r\n* Default value for PDF/A option changed to 0 to prevent issues with black background PNG files\r\n* Templates now can be \"Favorite\" to be displayed in the Create dropdown\r\n* Allow following a link from an external document without having to re-login (fix #3749)\r\n* Allow setting a file comment through Apiv2 file creation (fix #3848)\r\n* Add a way to filter bookable items by category (fix #1673)\r\n* Add live search on scheduler dropdowns\r\n* Add a new export menu in view mode\r\n* Let user select PDF/A format directly in the export menu, remove the user option\r\n* Add possibility to create a zip with PDF/A pdfs\r\n* Display team in template listing (fix #3855)\r\n* Always save a revision if none exist (1st save)\r\n* Remove the font-size in default template (fix #3927)\r\n* Make error notifications stay visible longer\r\n* Make text editor toolbar sticky (will stay visible when user scrolls down)\r\n* Rework how pdf are displayed, more compact layout\r\n\r\n## New features:\r\n\r\n* New version for REST API: APIv2, see documentation: https://doc.elabftw.net/api/v2/\r\n* Allow switching team from user menu (fix #3842)\r\n* Generate a log event on user login/logout\r\n* Add user account validity date\r\n* Add new compact display option for attachments with a button to toggle it easily\r\n* Add possibility to link to an experiment (previously only links to items were possible) (via #3728 by

show mode (fix #3799)\r\n* Allow multiple molecules in Chemdoodle area (#3746)\r\n* Allow saving molecule/reaction in .chemjson or export to PNG\r\n* Make timestamp archives immutables (fix #3656 via PR #3736)\r\n* Allow changing directly start and end date of scheduler event\r\n* Allow users to export their experiments from their profile (see #3726)\r\n* Add \"Show more information\" entry in

files\r\n* Allow display of uploaded txt files (via #3626 by Marcel)\r\n* Add button to copy step body into main text with a link that will highlight the step (fix #2407)\r\n* Allow users to use templates in markdown (fix #3070)\r\n* Add a markdown template for teams as default template\r\n* Add menu entry \"Open in NMRium\" for .jdx files\r\n* SAML: add setting to allow duplicate name attributes (fix #3867)\r\n* Add a changelog for all entries to record more changes than just the body with the revisions system\r\n* Add `blank_on_duplicate` attribute to extra_fields in metadata\r\n* Add created_at, timestamped_at and locked_at to extended search (#3960 by Marcel)\r\n* Allow using the API from an external host with javascript (see https://github.com/elabftw/elabapi-javascript-example#readme)\r\n* Add dynamic sort for tables (#3890, #3852 by Marcel)\r\n* Add white square as user defined symbol\r\n\r\n\r\n## Dev corner:\r\n\r\n*

This is because now there is a way to declare what kind of content we have (html or markdown), and by default it is html. To fix it, in edit mode of the experiment, click the top right menu (three vertical dots) and select \"Switch editor\" two times. Then save the experiment.\r\n\r\n### Bugfixes:\r\n\r\n* Fix hidden teams not showing up in Add team menu\r\n* Fix mass email from team page using user's email/name instead of the instance's\r\n* Don't restrict image size in body (fix #3800)\r\n* Fix incorrect semver comparison in Sysconfig Panel\r\n* Fix event deletion notification settings not honored\r\n* Fix filename download with non-ascii paramaters\r\n* Fix filename upon save after displaying it (fix #3797)\r\n* Remove deadline when finishing a step\r\n* Fix date parsing in APIv1\r\n* Fix displaying revisions requiring write access instead of read access (see #2304)\r\n* Fix codesample plugin of tinymce clashing with prismjs (fix #3712)\r\n\r\n### Enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Add currently logged in team in user menu\r\n* Display number of timestamps over the past 30 days on Sysconfig Panel\r\n* Add a new \"Sort\" menu in show mode with human readable labels\r\n* Prevent browser autompletion on Team page of Sysconfig Panel\r\n* Allow toggling pin mode in edit and show modes\r\n* Visually separate tags in pdf export\r\n* Add more columns to CSV scheduler export\r\n* Make \"Full syntax\" link on search page appear like a link\r\n* Improve user interface in UCP > Account\r\n* Set the default behavior to \"Select team\" for SAML/LDAP login\r\n* Use urlencode on password of smtp to avoid issues with special chars (fix #3748)\r\n* Import metadata column of CSV as metadata (fix #3055)\r\n* Force including attached files in timestamp pdf (fix #3729 via #3732)\r\n* Add toggle body button to links\r\n* Display 2FA status and userid of users as badges when listing them in Admin or Sysconfig panels\r\n* Default value for PDF/A option changed to 0 to prevent issues with black background PNG files\r\n* Templates now can be \"Favorite\" to be displayed in the Create dropdown\r\n\r\n### New features:\r\n\r\n* New version for REST API: APIv2, see documentation: https://doc.elabftw.net/api/v2/\r\n* Allow switching team from user menu (fix #3842)\r\n* Generate a log event on user login/logout\r\n* Add user account validity date\r\n* Add new compact display option for attachments with a button to toggle it easily\r\n* Add possibility to link to an experiment (previously only links to items were possible) (via #3728 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Add option for LDAP auth to let user select team upon creation (previously only for SAML)\r\n* Add visibility and groups filters in show mode (fix #2294)\r\n* Add owner filter in show mode (fix #3799)\r\n* Allow multiple molecules in Chemdoodle area (#3746)\r\n* Allow saving molecule/reaction in .chemjson or export to PNG\r\n* Make timestamp archives immutables (fix #3656 via PR #3736)\r\n* Allow changing directly start and end date of scheduler event\r\n* Allow users to export their experiments from their profile (see #3726)\r\n* Add \"Show more information\" entry in uploaded file menu\r\n* Add new dropdown menu on top right (PR #3718)\r\n* Add possibility to customize the Support link in help menu\r\n* Allow import/export of ELN files\r\n* Allow users to import files\r\n* Allow display of uploaded txt files (via #3626 by Marcel)\r\n\r\n### Dev corner:\r\n\r\n* Use APIv2 for internal calls, this resulted in a lot of code being deleted, which is a good thing.\r\n* Coverage data in html now retained by CircleCI in artifacts section\r\n* Use the Docker image for CircleCI\r\n* Use cache for php-cs-fixer\r\n* Fix issue with php-cs-fixer where excluded folders were not excluded\r\n* Do full test suite (including api) in CI\r\n* Use

4.3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Completely drop support for non-Docker installation method, [see why](https://doc.elabftw.net/docker-doc.html#why-can-t-i-run-it-outside-docker).\r\n* Require MySQL version 8.0. \r\n**WARNING** If you are running MySQL version 5.7 or earlier, you might run into encoding issues after updating to MySQL 8.0. First **make sure that you have a proper backup in UTF-8 before upgrading**. You might need to re-import your backup after the upgrade if you run into encoding issues.\r\n* A new mandatory configuration option (environment variable) `SITE_URL` is needed. Edit your configuration file (`/etc/elabftw.yml` by default) and add a new environment variable `SITE_URL` for the `web` (elabftw) container, in the environment part, with a value that corresponds to the address for the instance (including the port if not custom). If this value is not set, the container will show an error and the app won't work until it is fixed. This was previously an optional setting in the instance main config, but it was causing issues, see #3319. (PR #3323). Example:\r\n\r\n~~~yaml\r\n   SITE_URL=https://elab.example.org\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important changes:\r\n\r\n\r\n* When deletion is requested, the entry isn't really deleted but its `state` is set to deleted. It is not possible anymore to actually delete something . (PR #3302)\r\n* When an uploaded file is replaced by a new version, the previous version has its `state` changed to `archived` and is kept around.\r\n\r\n## New features:\r\n\r\n\r\n### For sysadmins:\r\n\r\n* You can now configure S3 storage for uploaded files (PR #3281) (and use bin/console uploads:migrate)\r\n* Add `uploads:prune` command to remove deleted files from database and filesystem\r\n* The `db:update` command now displays important messages at the end\r\n* Add `cache:clear` command to clear cached files\r\n* Allow user to request access to a team after SAML authentication (issue #3244, PR #3246)\r\n* Show MySQL version in sysadmin page (#3509 by Marcel)\r\n* Add a timestamp monthly limit (#3512)\r\n\r\n### For admins:\r\n\r\n* Allow export of data from the Admin panel: experiments, items or scheduler data (PR #3445) (fix #3386)\r\n* When an event is deleted from the scheduler, Admins get a notification\r\n\r\n### For users:\r\n\r\n* Allow searching for entities in API (issue #3264, PR #3308)\r\n* New notifications system (#3363)\r\n* Revamp completely the search interface, and allow complicated search queries, mainly by Marcel Bolten (PR #3247, PR #2975, fix #2677, PR #3555, #3554)\r\n* Add import link from link function (#3488)\r\n* Allow searching for several metadata fields on search page (#3473)\r\n* Allow searching in attachments filename and comment (PR #3515 by Marcel)\r\n* Add write permissions settings when importing CSV or ZIP (fix #3559)\r\n* Many other cosmetic changes and improvements all over the application.\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Fix steps block not getting updated in view mode after clicking the checkbox\r\n* Fix issue with template update on api (fix #3517)\r\n* Fix non working actions when navigating with the Favorite tags (issue #3329, PR #3331)\r\n* Fix bug where creating event resulted in changing the title of the item (issue #3326)\r\n* Actually use the Lato font for PDFs (issue #3211)\r\n* Fix team event binding behavior (PR #3301 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Fix page reloading on item type deletion preventing user from reading error message\r\n* Don't choke on password protected PDFs (PR #3288 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Avoid elabid overflow on small screens (PR #3260 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Fix url encoding issue in pdf qr code (issue #2940)\r\n* Fix html tags whitelisting (fix #3239)\r\n* Make sure every entity gets its own directory in zip file (#3446 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Fix half broken toggle body in show mode\r\n* Add possibly missing `authfail` table\r\n* Fix incorrect proxy setting for timestamping request (fix #3157)\r\n* Fix metadata not being duplicated for items (fix #3413)\r\n* Move show related action button (fix #3391)\r\n* Fix #3392, show mode issues\r\n* Fix issue with step edition/reload of element (#3506 by Marcel)\r\n* Fix incorrect parsing of query params for api (fix #3513)\r\n* Allow images to be centered (fix #3368)\r\n* Filter out archived users from user list autocomplete in admin panel (fix #3571)\r\n* Fix select elements in show mode menu\r\n\r\n## Enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Improve the edit users interface (PR #3551)\r\n* More robust exif reading for files with incorrect extension\r\n* Add link to register page after install script is done\r\n* Add user email on team group autocomplete (fix #3528)\r\n* Improve json editor/doodle/chemddoodle interface (PR #3526)\r\n* Always add the thumbnail image in pdf, not the full resolution one (fix #3103)\r\n* Minor API documentation fixes by Henning Timm (PR #3327)\r\n* Prevent issues when pasting from Word (issue #3193)\r\n* Append PDFs in multi mode (PR #3303 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Add user notification when things fail during PDF generation (PR #3283 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Improve some UI elements (PR #3304, PR #3259, PR #3257 by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Better handling of MathJax errors (PR #3155, see #3076, fix #3076, by Marcel Bolten)\r\n* Order linked items by category, then date, then title (fix #3280)\r\n* During CSV import, interpret the \"tags\" column to add tags (fix #3101)\r\n* Prevent modification of events in the past in scheduler (unless user is admin)\r\n* Add team selection filter on sysadmin panel/Users tab (fix #2764, PR #3444 by Marcel)\r\n* And other cosmetic enhancements by Marcel\r\n* Steps can now have a deadline set (#3415), with possibility to receive a notification, and the times are editable\r\n* Add confirmation dialog when unfinishing a step\r\n* Improve SAML implementation (#3389 by Maximilian H).

The 4.0.0! :tada: \r\n\r\nAfter many commits and contributions of all sort, I'm tagging the 4.0.0, knowing that patches will certainly follow-up ;)\r\n\r\nHave a look at the blog post presenting some new features: [Blog Post](https://www.deltablot.com/posts/release-400/)\r\n\r\nPlease read carefully the breaking changes below.\r\n\r\nThanks to all the contributors for their help in improving and testing this release!\r\n\r\n# Changelog for 4.0.0\r\n\r\n## BREAKING CHANGES\r\n\r\n\r\n### For both Docker and non-Docker users:\r\n\r\nMinimum MySQL version is 5.7.8 (due to the use of the JSON datatype).\r\n\r\n### For Docker users:\r\n\r\n* It appears that the UID/GID for uploaded files needs to be changed. For most users this means:\r\n\r\n`sudo chown -R 101:101 /path/to/elabftw/web`\r\n\r\nWhere the path points to the folder where uploaded files are stored. If you used in your configuration file a different UID/GID, use this instead of course.\r\n\r\n### For non-Docker users:\r\n\r\n\r\n* A domain/subdomain is required, subfolder installation are not supported anymore due to several hard to catch bugs and issues\r\n* PHP Version 8.0 is required\r\n* Install imagick PECL extension and remove gmagick extension. gmagick will be used if imagick is not found (with a fallback to gd).\r\n* The config line for the API has changed slightly. The new nginx config block is:\r\n\r\n~~~conf\r\n\r\n   location ~ ^/api/v1/(.*)/?$ {\r\n       rewrite /api/v1/(.*)$ /app/controllers/ApiController.php?req=$uri&args=$args last;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nFor Apache:\r\n\r\n~~~conf\r\nRewriteRule ^/api/v1/(.*)$ /app/controllers/ApiController.php?req=%{REQUEST_URI}&args=$args [P,L]\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugfixes:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Fix bug with LDAP authentication and team assignment\r\n* Fix print page in show mode (fix #2556 via #2557 by @MarcelBolten)\r\n* Fix file upload on FreeBSD platform\r\n* Make sure email domain restrictions apply everywhere (fix #2544)\r\n* Fix missing SQL constraints on experiments_revisions (#2540 co-authored by @m6121)\r\n* Fix issue with steps ordering after rearrange (fix #2457)\r\n* Fix html duplication (via #2423 by @MarcelBolten)\r\n* Fix action icons sometimes not working (fix #2420 via #2424 by @MarcelBolten)\r\n* Fix bug where limit in show mode was not honoured after filter/sort/order\r\n* Fix notification overlay in tinymce fullscreen (fix #2419 via #2440 by @MarcelBolten)\r\n* Fix issue with malformed UTF-8 characters (fix #2404)\r\n* Fix issue with SAML login and sending admin email\r\n* Fix long upload filenames wrapping (fix #2719)\r\n* Fix scheduler entry binding user experience (see #2366)\r\n\r\n## New features:\r\n\r\n\r\n* Allow sysadmin to clear the banned users from too many failed login attempts (tab Security in the panel)\r\n* Allow users to set the visibility to \"User only\", previously this setting included admins of the team and the labelling wasn't clear about it.

So if you were using `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` to store the logs, you will now need to use `docker logs elabftw` to see them. Use `docker logs elabftw 1>/dev/null` to see only errors and `docker logs elabftw 2>/dev/null` to see only access log.

Then update the containers (`elabctl update`) and then the database, as described below.\r\n\r\nChangelog\r\n=========\r\n\r\nVersion 3.5.0\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis is a major update. After updating the container, you will need to run the update script:\r\n\r\n~~~bash\r\n # with docker\r\n docker exec -it elabftw bin/console db:update\r\n # without docker\r\n php bin/console db:update\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n**Breaking changes**:\r\n\r\nIf you are using Docker (and you should :p), the access and error logs are now sent to stdout and stderr of the container. So if you were using `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` to store the logs, you will now need to use `docker logs elabftw` to see them. Use `docker logs elabftw 1>/dev/null` to see only errors and `docker logs elabftw 2>/dev/null` to see only access log. This change was done to align with docker best practices and should facilitate central logging.\r\n\r\n**New features**:\r\n\r\n* Enforce read/write permissions of experiments by Admin (#1999)\r\n* The Todolist is now also showing the unfinished steps in experiments (#2024)\r\n* The Todolist will stay open on page change\r\n* External authentication (contributed by @manu0401) (PR #2023). If the webserver is providing authentication, use this to login the user. Also provide an URL for logout. Add parameters in Sysconfig page to configure external auth\r\n* Add proper Single Log Out (#1691)\r\n* Steps on experiments are now sortable and editable (#904)\r\n* Add pinned entities. A pinned experiment or item will stay on top of the page in show mode\r\n* Add Ctrl+= and Ctrl+Shift+= for subscript/superscript (#1556)\r\n* Add JSON export from show mode\r\n* Generate a single PDF file with all selected items (PR #2038) (#434) Contribution by Marcel Bolten\r\n* Show related items in view/edit mode (PR #1993) (#1432) Contribution by Marcel Bolten\r\n* Allow file upload with copy/past (PR #1886) Contribution by Sherjeel Shabih\r\n* Display a link to the scheduler on experiments bound to a scheduler event\r\n* Order the links by name (#1940)\r\n* Add template permissions similar to exp/items permissions (PR #1885) (#1668) Contribution by Max Schr\u00f6der and Farrukh Faizy\r\n* Allow hiding a team from the register select\r\n\r\n**Enhancements**:\r\n\r\n* Make one less SQL request on page load if admin\r\n* Use correct background color for events on creation in scheduler\r\n* Allow several whitelisted email domains (#1836)\r\n* Display Mathjax in preview mode of markdown editor (#892)\r\n* Add the filter/order/sort/limit menu on Search page\r\n* Add a Tag input in show mode to look for tags\r\n* Increase the size limit of hashed files on upload\r\n* Don't try to rotate tif files (#2071)\r\n* Logout user after use of an eLabID link\r\n* Add month view in scheduler\r\n* Show templates from other teams on Team page (#1457)\r\n* Hide the import button from Links in templates (#1745)\r\n* Make the Todolist push the content to the right (#1871)\r\n* Fix the Json editor +/- button when loading a file\r\n* Prevent Tinymce from showing raw html on editor load\r\n* Don't show the Tags line in pdf in there are none\r\n* Use bootstrap-select in some selects so the options can be filtered\r\n* Send notif to user that needs validation and send user info to admin(s)\r\n* Change min delte characters for revision create from 20 to 100 (helps reduce the db size growth). Might be configurable later on\r\n\r\n**i18n**:\r\n\r\n* Several new strings translated. Add i18next library to translate in javascript\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**:\r\n\r\n* Fix wrong IDP used when several active IDPs were configured\r\n* Fix potential issues spotted by static analysis\r\n* Fix count of experiments in report (#2025)\r\n\r\n**Updates**:\r\n\r\n* Update prismjs\r\n\r\n**Docker**:\r\n\r\n* Add possibility so configure a user and group for nginx.

I can move the web served directory to a separate directory that is not the root directory of the repo. This means the `uploads` folder is not in the webdir anymore which is better for several reasons. I can update different components to a major version (bootstrap, twig), use Webpack to deal better with the Javascripts, remove all the minified files from the git tracking. This means more work to install it without Docker, but the Docker method being the recommended one it's ok. It also means the repository is smaller and faster to clone. So basically with 2.0 I felt free to break everything and then rebuild it better after, without having to worry about anything (as long as I can write a proper upgrade documentation for non docker users!).\r\n\r\n## CHANGELOG:\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n\r\n* Add Slovak lang \u2212 thanks to Martin Petriska from Bratislava\r\n* Add 100% translated Russian lang \u2212 thanks to Mark T\r\n* Database items now have comments (#508)\r\n* Add option in user control panel to allow experiment edition from members of the team (#498)\r\n* Allow creation of Links through API (#599)\r\n* Add a Tag Manager in the admin panel so the admin can correct typos or remove tags (#715)\r\n* Add Mathjax support for pretty mathematical expressions (#208)\r\n* Add visibility to database items (#541)\r\n* Add support for Nanobox.io deployment\r\n* Add possibility to add a caption to inserted images (#241)\r\n* Add Open Science mode allowing unregistered users to read experiments in a team (#718)\r\n* Add EXPERIMENTAL feature for streaming zip archives (allows big zip) Enable it from UCP.\r\n* Add option for french style signatures block in pdf (#726)\r\n* Add possibility to download file through API (#798 #797)\r\n\r\nEnhancements:\r\n\r\n* Allow to search for tags with string from the middle of the tag (#702)\r\n* Better user interface for Steps, Links and Todolist (#559)\r\n* Show steps in view mode\r\n* Use SVG icons instead of PNG\r\n* Show owner in show mode if not current user for experiments (#616)\r\n* Add relative moment for displaying a date\r\n* Display locked date in view mode when hovering the lock icon (#189)\r\n* Add Steps to PDFs (#189)\r\n* Add more actions to the top right menu\r\n* Page load is cleaner\r\n* Add a version query string to assets to prevent caching of old versions\r\n* Add more infos on Sysconfig page and reorganize the tabs\r\n* Show 25 items instead of 10 for mention plugin (#641)\r\n* Remove the 60 characters limit on autocomplete\r\n* Updated translations\r\n* Zip generation is less likely to fail\r\n\r\nBugfixes:\r\n\r\n* Display edit icon in show mode for admins (#498)\r\n* Fix permission issue when deleting experiment from show mode\r\n* Fix order by category not working for experiments (#698)\r\n* Fix revisions for admin (#662)\r\n* Fix issues in SAML login if team is empty\r\n* Fix tags not being imported when template is duplicated\r\n* Fix steps/link not working with a '%' character (#791)\r\n* Fix possibility to update category/visibility of locked item (#792)\r\n* Fix issue with order by and sort (#790)\r\n* Fix issue with comments (#802)\r\n\r\nDev corner:\r\n\r\n* Mininum PHP version is now 7.1\r\n* Update SwiftMailer to version 6\r\n* Update Twig to version 2\r\n* Update Bootstrap to version 4\r\n* Use Webpack 4 to create bundles (using tree shaking feature to make smaller bundles)\r\n* Use ES6 syntax for Javascript (const/let instead of var for instance)\r\n* Drop phpdocumentor dependency in composer.json, use the phar instead\r\n* Use type hinting\r\n* Use strict_types\r\n* Replace strlen() by mb_strlen()\r\n* Use dirname() instead of relative paths\r\n* Move the `cache` folder outside of `uploads`\r\n* Split code in `web` and `src` folders\r\n* Function signatures are more coherent\r\n* Use random_bytes() to get random numbers\r\n* Use chromedriver for acceptance tests\r\n* Deduplicate the mysql structure file\r\n* Remove custom css class.

Once archived, a user can register another account in another team if needed, with the same email.\r\n\r\n### Import templates from the team\r\nOn the TEAM page, you can now see the templates from others in the team, and import them to your profile.\r\n\r\n### Uploads replace\r\nIf you need to upload a newer version of a file, you can use the adequate button \"Upload a new version of this file\" to replace the file quickly.\r\n\r\n### Docker changes\r\nSome changes in the container were made to improve:\r\n* the starting speed (by making the DH generation in the background)\r\n* the container security (by restricting PHP greatly and storing sessions more securely)\r\n* the application security (by adding a restrictive Content Security Policy header)\r\n\r\nThere is also a few new settings that can be added to the main configuration file as environment variables:\r\n* [PHP_TIMEZONE](https://github.com/elabftw/elabimg/blob/master/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE#L46) to set the timezone\r\n* [MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE](https://github.com/elabftw/elabimg/blob/master/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE#L44) to change the maximum allowed file size for uploaded files\r\n* [MAX_PHP_MEMORY](https://github.com/elabftw/elabimg/blob/master/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE#L42) to change the maximum allowed memory for the PHP process\r\n* [SET_REAL_IP](https://github.com/elabftw/elabimg/blob/master/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE#L48) and [SET_REAL_IP_FROM](https://github.com/elabftw/elabimg/blob/master/src/docker-compose.yml-EXAMPLE#L51) if you need to tell nginx to set the real ips from these addresses (if you're behind a load balancer for instance)\r\n\r\n## Here is a full list of the changes:\r\n\r\n* New features:\r\n\r\n  * Add possibility to bulk change visibility for experiments (#527)\r\n  * Add user option to prevent pdf from displaying attached files (#502)\r\n  * Add possibility to add a tag from the API (#468)\r\n  * Add option to disable PDF/A generation and make pdf lighter (no embedded fonts)\r\n  * Add option to change paper format of PDF (A4, Letter, Royal)\r\n  * Add possibility to allow anonymous logins (#279)\r\n  * Add Public visibility to experiments. Will be visible to anonymous users\r\n  * Add possibility to archive a user. The user can then create another account in another team (#483)\r\n  * Add possibility to see and import templates from other members of the team\r\n  * Add button to replace existing uploaded file with new version (#501)\r\n\r\n* Enhancements:\r\n\r\n  * Add link to revisions from view mode (#536)\r\n  * Add pagination\r\n\r\n* Updates:\r\n\r\n  * Update Tinymce to 4.7.4\r\n  * Update Fancybox to 3.2.5\r\n  * Update Fullcalendar to 3.7.0\r\n  * Update 3Dmol.js to 1.3.0\r\n  * Update mPDF to version 7.0.2\r\n\r\n* Docker:\r\n\r\n  * Remove unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval from the Content Security Policy header: now elabftw can be used with a very restrictive CSP header\r\n  * Make the Diffie-Hellman parameters generation in background for faster webserver startup\r\n  * Disable unsafe functions in php.ini\r\n  * Enable open_basedir restriction\r\n  * Use longer SID, store sessions in separate directory with restrictive permissions\r\n  * Disable allow_url_fopen\r\n  * Add config for PHP timezone\r\n  * Add config for setting \"set_real_ip_from\" in nginx config\r\n\r\n* Bugfixes:\r\n\r\n  * Fix bug where very long titles without spaces would break the layout (#517)\r\n  * Fix bug where deleting a tag would result in another tag of the same item being deleted (#504)\r\n  * Restrict scheduler slots edit to owner (#506)\r\n  * Fix a display issue with very long titles with no spaces (#517)\r\n  * Fix incorrect redirection in subfolder install (#549)", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/1.8.0", "zipball_url":

Read more about it in [the changelog](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html). If you are using Docker, just do as usual.\n\nThis is because the `vendor` directory is not tracked by git anymore. So you need to install composer and install the php dependencies with composer yourself after an update (only git users, not Docker). Also, the documentation moved to another repository, the API doc is no more visible in the repo, and there is no more the gh-page branch (elabftw.net is no longer a github page, allowing me to have https). All of these changes make the repo much much lighter. And the commit log will not be polluted by documentation changes, etc. These changes don't really impact your average user, but for developers it's much better like this :)\n\nI like the \"release early, release often\" mantra, so I don't want to keep these changes forever in a branch. So here it is.\n\nIn this release:\n- New features:\n  - **Autosave feature** when editing an experiment or an item\n  - Admin can now see experiments with visibility set to 'only me' (fix #307)\n- Enhancements:\n  - Improve responsive design for mobile\n  - Show installed version even if we can't access latest\n  - Show date of latest release in sysadmin panel\n  - Allow the use of unencrypted SMTP server\n- Bugfixes:\n  - Redirect to the install folder directly after install if SQL is not imported\n  - Allow scrolling of text if it is very wide instead of just hiding it (fix #314)\n- Internationalization:\n  - Translated to Slovenian at 100% (thanks to Petra Kaferle)\n  - Translated to Portuguese (Brazilian) at 100% (thanks to Carlos Kikuti)\n- Docker image\n  - Repository is now named elabftw/elabimg\n  - Some capabilities are dropped\n  - Composer is now installed in order to populate the vendor/ dir\n- Dev corner:\n  - The git repository got ligther. Documentation is now in `elabftw/elabdoc`. API doc is untracked. www.elabftw.net website is no more on the gh-pages branch but on `elabftw/elabweb`. With the removal of the `vendor` dir, this brings the total size of the repo down by about 50%.\n  - img/ dir moved to app/\n\n### [How to update](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how-to-update.html)\n\n### [How to install](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/1.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/1.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/1.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/4943174", "release_id": 4943174, "date_created": "2016-12-16T16:43:13Z", "date_published": "2016-12-16T16:57:52Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/4432245", "tag": "1.3.1", "name": "elabftw-1.3.1", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "This patch fixes two bugs:\n- fix bug where admin of a team didn't receive an email when a new user registered\n- fix bug where scheduler was not working on some browser/operating system combinations\n\nRelease notes for 1.3.0:\nThis release brings new features and some bug fixes.

If you are upgrading from 1.2.1, a simple git pull is enough. The main issue was a typo preventing users to reset their password. See [the changelog](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) for full list of changes.\n\n**PLEASE READ THE NOTES BELOW**\n\n**If you are upgrading from 1.2.0-p3** : \nThere is a major update to the Crypto library used to store the encrypted passwords (for SMTP and timestamp). It will need to write a new key to the config file. **If you are using Docker, make sure to read [the changelog](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/hypernext/changelog.html#version-1-2-1)!**\n\n**WARNING : for Docker users you need a manual step!!!** Check [the changelog](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/hypernext/changelog.html#version-1-2-1).\n\nFor non docker users, make sure that `config.php` is writeable by the webserver (see changelog). Try `chmod 777 config.php`. If it's not, it will tell you anyway.\n\n**For Mac OS users**\nIf you get an 'Integrity check fail' error. First make sure your config file is writeable (`chmod 777 config.php`). And run these SQL commands from phpmyadmin (select the elabftw database and click SQL to run SQL commands).\n**WARNING** this will delete the smtp password that you have saved in the sysconfig panel! (and any timestamping password you might have put). Make sure that you know this password!\n\n``` sql\nupdate config set conf_value = '' where conf_name = 'smtp_password';\nupdate config set conf_value = '' where conf_name = 'stamppass';\nupdate teams set stamppass = null where team_id = 1;\n```\n\nRefresh the page and everything should be good. Put back your smtp password now. See issue #268.\n\n**If you are upgrading from before 1.2.0-p3** please upgrade first to 1.2.0-p3. First, read the [release notes](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/1.2.0-p2), and then upgrade if you have php > 5.6. You can do that like this:\n\n``` sh\n#instead of doing git pull, we pull a specific version\ngit pull origin 1.2.0-p3\n```\n\nSee the [changelog](https://elabftw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html) for a complete list of changes.\n\n---\n\nAs you can see, there are a lot of releases for elabftw. Well, that's because it's actively developed and maintained. Also, I don't like to have bugs in the latest release, so I release another one with a patch immediatly after a (critical) bug is found. In the next releases I will focus more on bringing new features (like a booking system) than improving the codebase. But it always has to be a balance between improving codebase/updating libraries (so changing things that the user will not see) and introducing new features. Lately it has been more on the improving the codebase side because eLab needed a good rewrite of the internal code to be more efficient, smart and fast. This previous work will also facilitate future improvements to the software. Think of building a house, you need good foundations.\n\neLabFTW is rapidly gaining popularity amongst researchers and research institute around the globe. This is very good news, it means it answers a demand for a free, open-source electronic lab notebook allowing timestamping of experiments.\n\nThanks to everyone who contributed so far, by translating, writing code or finding issues :)\n\nENJOY!\n\n~Nico\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/1.2.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/1.2.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/1.2.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/3558756", "release_id": 3558756, "date_created": "2016-06-30T11:18:56Z", "date_published": "2016-06-30T17:22:52Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/3508003", "tag": "1.2.1", "name": "elabftw-1.2.1", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "Hello,\n\nThis release is a major update to the Crypto library used to store the encrypted passwords (for SMTP and timestamp).

Now it can be run from the web.\n\nIn fact I wanted to implement an easy way to get a new release, but it's not as easy as wordpress makes it look like. So we ended up in a weird situation, with the code to get and extract the latest zip archive is written, but not directly accessible because it's missing the last part : copying the extracted files over the old ones. (pull requests welcome ;) )\n\nOf course this decision was driven by the fact that in the institute I work in, elabftw is run in a docker container, where you can't just ssh in it to update the database (well, you can but that's not the point). I think being able to run elabftw in a container is a good thing, so I try to change the code so it 'fits'.\n\nAlso in this release, there is a fix for using haproxy to handle ssl traffic to an http server. Not a lot of people will benefit from it, but it's here now. I want elabftw to be entreprise capable, and this kind of thing is often found in a complex network architecture, which is in turn often found in a modern research institute.\n\nFinally, I added a little counter in the footer of the admin, so he can see if there is some users to validate.\n\nAs you might have noticed, the release schedule of elabftw is quite chaotic. And the length of the text accompanying the release is random (last release had two words...).\nBut that's the way I work. I publish a release, and not long after I start spotting bugs, so I need to make another release now that the recommended way to install is not git clone anymore but downloading the latest stable release, and the cycle goes on...\n\nBTW, there is nothing stable in elabftw (yet), it needs to be considered as 'beta' software until it reaches version 1.0. It's stable in the way that it will not spontaneously explode, and globally works fine,  but the code is getting improved all the time!\n\nIf you are still reading, cheers :smiley: \n\nTo conclude : thanks to everyone participating in this elabftw adventure. We're building the best ELN software together :D \n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/0.12.6", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/0.12.6", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/0.12.6", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/927706", "release_id": 927706, "date_created": "2015-02-06T20:05:02Z", "date_published": "2015-02-06T20:22:24Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/922299", "tag": "0.12.5", "name": "elabftw-0.12.5", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "Bugfixes release.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/0.12.5", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/0.12.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/0.12.5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/922299", "release_id": 922299, "date_created": "2015-02-05T16:03:41Z", "date_published": "2015-02-05T16:04:45Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/774438", "tag": "0.12.3", "name": "elabftw-0.12.3", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "This minor update facilitates install in a Docker container and fix 1 minor bug.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/0.12.3", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/0.12.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/0.12.3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/774438", "release_id": 774438, "date_created": "2014-12-11T11:49:29Z", "date_published": "2014-12-11T11:52:33Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/738473", "tag": "0.12.2", "name": "elabftw-0.12.2", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "Only one bugfix in here, in update.php file.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/tarball/0.12.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/zipball/0.12.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/releases/tag/0.12.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/738473", "release_id": 738473, "date_created": "2014-11-27T13:13:59Z", "date_published": "2014-11-27T13:15:12Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/elabftw/elabftw/releases/729524", "tag": "0.12.1", "name": "elabftw-0.12.1", "author": {"name": "NicolasCARPi", "type": "User"}, "description": "Ok, so I messed up a bit (forgot to pull before tagging).
