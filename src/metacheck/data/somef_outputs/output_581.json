If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   We use [air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to format the code style. \n    But please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the {AAGIPalettes} project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy contributing to this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_build_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "format": "description"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "AAGIPalettes", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "version": [{"result": {"value": "0.0.1", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "0.0.1", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIPalettes/main/codemeta.json"}], "authors": [{"result": {"value": [{"value": "Adam H.
