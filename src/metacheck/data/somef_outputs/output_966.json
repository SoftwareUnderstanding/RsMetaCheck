These issues can be mitigated by drug repurposing, where chemical compounds are screened for new therapeutic indications in a systematic fashion. In prior works, this approach has been implemented through collaborative filtering. This semi-supervised learning framework leverages known drug-disease matchings in order to recommend new ones. \nThe *stanscofi* package comprises method-agnostic training, validation, preprocessing and visualization procedures on several published drug repurposing datasets. The proper implementation of these steps is crucial in order to avoid data leakage, *i*.*e*., the model is learnt over information that should be unavailable at prediction time. Indeed, data leakage is the source of a major reproducibility crisis in machine learning. This will be avoided by building training and validation sets which are weakly correlated with respect to the drug and disease feature vectors. The main performance metric will be the area under the curve (AUC), which estimates the diagnostic ability of a recommender system better than accuracy in imbalanced datasets. \n", "original_header": "Statement of need"}, "confidence": 0.9706454419256273, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://github.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/blob/master/README.md"}], "name": [{"result": {"value": "stanscofi", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "stanscofi", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/master/codemeta.json"}], "full_name": [{"result": {"value": "RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "issue_tracker": [{"result": {"value": "https://api.github.com/repos/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/issues", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "https://github.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/issues", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/master/codemeta.json"}], "forks_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://api.github.com/repos/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/forks", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "stargazers_count": [{"result": {"value": 1, "type": "Number"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "keywords": [{"result": {"value": "collaborative-filtering, drug-repurposing, open-science, python, science-reproducibility", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/master/setup.py"}, {"result": {"value": ["Python", "collaborative filtering", "open science", "drug repurposing", "science reproducibility"], "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/master/codemeta.json"}], "forks_count": [{"result": {"value": 1, "type": "Number"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "homepage": [{"result": {"value": "https://recess-eu-project.github.io/stanscofi/", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "download_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/releases", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "https://github.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/archive/refs/heads/master.zip", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/master/codemeta.json"}], "programming_languages": [{"result": {"value": "Python", "name": "Python", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 152176}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "TeX", "name": "TeX", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 12947}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "Dockerfile", "name": "Dockerfile", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 496}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"name": "Python 3", "value": "Python 3", "type": "Programming_language"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/master/codemeta.json"}], "releases": [{"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/RECeSS-EU-Project/stanscofi/releases/147788407", "tag": "v2.0.1", "name": "stanscofi v2.0.1", "author": {"name": "RECeSS-EU-Project", "type": "User"}, "description": "Package for STANdard drug Screening by COllaborative FIltering.
