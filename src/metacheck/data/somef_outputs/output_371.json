Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3.

If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/master/LICENSE"}, {"result": {"value": "./COPYRIGHT", "type": "License", "identifier": "https://spdx.org/licenses/./COPYRIGHT", "spdx_id": "./COPYRIGHT"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/master/codemeta.json"}], "description": [{"result": {"value": "C++ Message Queuing Library and Framework", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "C++ Message Queuing Library and Framework", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/master/codemeta.json"}, {"result": {"value": "FairMQ is designed to help implementing large-scale data processing workflows needed in next-generation Particle Physics experiments. FairMQ is written in C++ and aims to\n  * provide **an asynchronous message passing abstraction** of different data transport technologies,\n  * provide a reasonably **efficient data transport** service (zero-copy, high throughput),\n  * be **data format agnostic**, and\n  * provide **basic building blocks** that can be used to implement higher level data processing workflows.\n\nThe core of FairMQ provides an abstract asynchronous message passing API with scalability protocols\ninspired by [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) (e.g. PUSH/PULL, PUB/SUB).\nFairMQ provides multiple implementations for its API (so-called \"transports\",\ne.g. `zeromq` and `shmem` (latest release of the `ofi` transport in v1.4.56, removed since v1.5+)) to cover\na variety of use cases\n(e.g. inter-thread, inter-process, inter-node communication) and machines (e.g. Ethernet, Infiniband).\nIn addition to this core functionality FairMQ provides a framework for creating \"devices\" - actors which\nare communicating through message passing. FairMQ does not only allow the user to use different transport\nbut also to mix them; i.e: A Device can communicate using different transport on different channels at the\nsame time. Device execution is modelled as a simple state machine that shapes the integration points for\nthe user task. Devices also incorporate a plugin system for runtime configuration and control.\nNext to the provided [devices](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/tree/master/fairmq/devices) and\n[plugins](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ/tree/master/fairmq/plugins) the user can extend FairMQ\nby developing his own plugins to integrate his devices with external configuration and control services.\n\nFairMQ has been developed in the context of its mother project [FairRoot](https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairRoot) -\na simulation, reconstruction and analysis framework.\n",
