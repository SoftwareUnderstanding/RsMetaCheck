When writing code that relies on interactions with databases, testing has been difficult without recreating test databases in your continuous integration (aka CI) environment, or resorting to using SQLite databases instead of the database engines you have in production. Both have their downsides: recreating database infrastructure is slow, error prone, and hard to iterate with. Using SQLite works well, right up until you use a feature (like [a full outer join](https://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html)) or has [quirks](https://www.sqlite.org/quirks.html) that might differ from your production database. `dittodb` solves this by recording database interactions, saving them as mocks, and then replaying them seamlessly during testing.

For detailed information \nabout developing `dittodb` see the [developing `dittodb` vignette](articles/developing-dittodb.html).\n\n\n### Fixing typos\n\nSmall typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using\nthe GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.\nWe love getting help with this!\n\n* **Yes, please:** you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file under the `R/` directory.\n* **No, thanks:** you edit an `.Rd` file under the `man/` directory.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nIn order to not waste effort and time, before you make a substantial pull request,\nyou should file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s a \nproblem. If you\u2019ve found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the \nbug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We recommend that you create a new git branch for each pull request (PR).\n*  Look at the GitHub Actions build status before and after making changes.\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with\n[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html),\nfor documentation.\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.\n*  New code should generally follow the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that

offensive,\nor harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\ncomments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\nnot aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation\ndecisions when appropriate.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when\nan

No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
