The guide is divided into two main pieces:\n  \n* Filing a bug report or feature request in an issue.\n* Suggesting a change via a pull request.\n\n## Issues\n\nWhen filing an issue, the most important thing is to include a minimal\nreproducible example so that we can quickly verify the problem, and then figure\nout how to fix it. There are three things you need to include to make your\nexample reproducible: required packages, data, code.\n\n1.  **Packages** should be loaded at the top of the script, so it's easy to\nsee which ones the example needs.\n\n2.  The easiest way to include **data** is to use `dput()` to generate the R\ncode to recreate it.\n\n3.  Spend a little bit of time ensuring that your **code** is easy for others to\nread:\n\n* make sure you've used spaces and your variable names are concise, but\ninformative\n\n* use comments to indicate where your problem lies\n\n* do your best to remove everything that is not related to the problem.\nThe shorter your code is, the easier it is to understand.\n\nYou can check you have actually made a reproducible example by starting up a\nfresh R session and pasting your script in.\n\n(Unless you've been specifically asked for it, please don't include the output\n  of `sessionInfo()`.)\n\n## Pull requests\n\nTo contribute a change to `iml`, you follow these steps:\n  \n1. Create a branch in git and make your changes.\n2. Push branch to github and issue pull request (PR).\n3. Discuss the pull request.\n4. Iterate until either we accept the PR or decide that it's not a good fit for\n   `iml`.\n\nEach of these steps are described in more detail below. This might feel\noverwhelming the first time you get set up, but it gets easier with practice.\n\nIf you're not familiar with git or GitHub, please start by reading\n<http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html>\n  \n  Pull requests will be evaluated against the a checklist:\n  \n1.  __Motivation__. Your pull request should clearly and concisely motivates the\nneed for change. Please describe the problem your PR addresses and show\nhow your pull request solves it as concisely as possible.\n\n    Also include this motivation in `NEWS` so that when a new release of\n`iml` comes out it's easy for users to see what's changed. Add your\nitem at the top of the file and use markdown for formatting. The\nnews item should end with `(@yourGithubUsername, #the_issue_number)`.\n\n2.  __Only related changes__. Before you submit your pull request, please\ncheck to make sure that you haven't accidentally included any unrelated\nchanges. These make it harder to see exactly what's changed, and to\nevaluate any unexpected side effects. \n\n    Each PR corresponds to a git branch, so if you expect to submit\nmultiple changes make sure to create multiple branches. If you have\nmultiple changes that depend on each other, start with the first one\nand don't submit any others until the first one has been processed.\n\n3.  If you're adding new parameters or a new function, you'll also need\n    to document them with [roxygen](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen).\n    Make sure to re-run `devtools::document()` on the code before submitting.\n\nThis seems like a lot of work but don't worry if your pull request isn't\nperfect. It's a learning process. A pull request is a process, and unless\nyou've submitted a few in the past it's unlikely that your pull request will be\naccepted as is. Please don't submit pull requests that change existing\nbehaviour. Instead, think about how you can add a new feature in a minimally\ninvasive way.", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":
