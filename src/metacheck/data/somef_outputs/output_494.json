This project offers a comprehensive simulation platform designed for developing, testing, and refining search strategies using drone swarms. Researchers and developers will find a versatile toolset supporting a broad spectrum of simulations, which facilitates the exploration of complex drone behaviors and interactions in dynamic, real-world scenarios. \nIn this repository, we have implemented two distinct types of environments. The first is a dynamic environment that simulates maritime search and rescue operations for shipwreck survivors. It models the movement of individuals in the sea using a dynamic probability matrix, with the objective for drones being to locate and identify these individuals. The second is a environment utilizing the Lagrangian particle simulation from the open-source [Opendrift library](https://github.com/OpenDrift/opendrift), which incorporates real-world ocean and wind data to create a probability matrix for drone SAR tasks. In this scenario, drones are tasked with covering the full search area within the lowest time possible, while prioritizing higher probability areas. \n", "original_header": "<img

Environment project!**\n\nWe're thrilled that you're interested in contributing to our project. Your involvement is essential for keeping up to date with the most recent reinforcement learning community study & research needs. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, or improving the documentation, your contributions are welcome!\n\nHere\u2019s how you can contribute:\n\n1. **Explore our issues**: Start by looking through the [issues](https://github.com/pfeinsper/drone-swarm-search/issues) on our GitHub repository.\n\n2. **Fork and clone the repository**: Once you've found an issue to work on, fork the repository and then clone it to your local machine so you can start your work.\n\n3. **Set up your environment**: We strongly recommend using [Python's Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to manage your dependencies. Setting up a virtual environment helps isolate and manage the packages specific to our project, ensuring compatibility and preventing conflicts with other projects.\n\n4. **Make your changes**: Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps the work organized and makes it easy for you to start different contributions on new branches without conflicts.\n\n5. **Test your changes**: Before submitting your pull request, make sure your changes do not break any existing functionality. We appreciate if you add tests to cover new code or bugs.\n\n6. **Submit a pull request**: Push your changes to your fork and submit a pull request to the main project. Fill in the provided PR template with all requested details. Explain the reason for your changes and how they improve the project.\n\n7. **Review process**: The maintainers will review your pull request as soon as possible. Participate in the discussion, and make any requested changes. We aim to work collaboratively to ensure that every contribution is of high quality.\n\n8. **Stay involved**: Contributions don\u2019t end with a pull request! You can help out by reviewing other people's pull requests, providing constructive feedback, and engaging in discussions to make the project better for everyone.\n\n## Testing\n\n**Ensuring Quality with Automated Tests**\n\nIn our project, we maintain high standards of quality and reliability by rigorously testing our code. We use [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), a powerful testing framework for Python, to write and run our tests.\n\nAll of our tests are located in the `DSSE/tests` directory. This structure helps keep the tests organized and separate from the main codebase.\n\nBefore you submit your changes, you must run the existing tests to ensure that your contributions do not break any current functionality. To run the tests, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Navigate to the project root**: Change to the directory where your project is located.\n   \n2. **Activate your virtual environment**: Ensure that your virtual environment is active to use the project-specific dependencies.\n\n3. **Run the tests**: Execute the following command to run all tests:\n   ```\n   pytest\n   ```\n\n## Coding Conventions\n\n**Maintaining Code Quality**\n\nIn our project, we strive for excellence in our codebase and uphold high standards for readability, maintainability, and efficiency. To achieve this, we base our coding conventions on the principles found in *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship* by Robert C. Martin.\n\n### Why Clean Code?\n\n*Clean Code* provides guidelines and best practices designed to improve the overall quality of software. Adhering to these principles aids in producing code that is not only functional but also clean and understandable to others. Here are a few key conventions we follow:\n\n1. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive, specific names for variables, functions, and classes. Names should clearly reflect their function and the data they hold.\n\n2. **Functions Should Do One Thing**: Functions must be small and focused. They should perform one task and do it well, which simplifies testing, debugging, and maintenance.\n\n3. **Clean Tests**: Just as with production code, cleanliness is crucial in test code. Tests should be concise, expressive, and cover both expected and edge case scenarios.\n\n4. **Handling Errors**: Error handling is important for maintaining the integrity of the application. It should be clear, concise, and must not obscure logic.\n\n5. **Code Formatting**: Consistent formatting is not just aesthetic; it promotes readability and reduces the cognitive load for all developers. Follow the format settings in our repository to ensure consistency.\n\nIf you have any questions or need assistance with your contributions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our community for help. We aim to make your experience as enjoyable and productive as possible!\n\nThank you for contributing to our project! We truly appreciate your efforts and are excited to see what you build with us.\n\nBest regards,\n\n**The Development Team:**\n\n- **Renato Laffranchi**, Computer Engineer\n- **Pedro Andrade**, Computer Engineer\n- **Ricardo Rodrigues**, Computer Engineer\n- **Jor\u00e1s Oliveira**, Computer Engineer\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pfeinsper/drone-swarm-search/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "We welcome contributions from developers to improve and expand our repository. Here are some ways you can contribute:\n\n1. **Creating Issues:** If you encounter any bugs, have suggestions for new features, or have a question, please create an issue on our GitHub repository.
