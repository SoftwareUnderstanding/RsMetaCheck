This is breaking in the sense that the output of `say` is fundamentally different assuming you care about ascii art.\r\n* `say` color args change: `by_color` param now by default is whatever is set for `what_color` - allowing for setting one color for both the quote and the animal. If no colors are supplied behavior is unchanged from previous version. (#85)\r\n* Imports changed. `rmsfact` and `fortunes` were previously Imports but are now Suggests because they are not in fact needed for the main use case of the package. Simply load them if you need them and this package helps when needed. \r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* new function `think()` to duplicate what cowthink function does with command line cowsay - different bubble sides and tail (see examples) (#93)\r\n* A user (@oganm) suggested removing the speech bubble from the ascii art - and we agree! `say` has been refactored, now using separate new functions `bubble_say`/`bubble_think` and `bubble_tail` to construct the quote/speech bubble and its tail. The tail from the bubble to the animal has changed position so that it attempts to be at a position that makes sense for the specific animal. You can use these separate new functions yourself to manually do what `say` and `think` do. See the docs for details (`?bubble_say`/`?bubble_tail`) (#67)\r\n* New special variants of cows added to match the original cowsay command line flags -b, -d, -g, -s, -t, -w, and -y, which refer to Borg, dead, greedy, sleepy, tired, wired, and young appearance modes for the cow, respectively. Instead of adding a new parameter for this (trying to avoid parameter bloat) - and since this is just for cow - you can get these cow variants by supplying for animal cow + dead as \"cow_dead\" for example, instead of just \"cow\".\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* Added notes about history of cowsay in readme (#94)\r\n* remove `multicolor` package for good as it's not coming back to CRAN (#90)\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* stegosaurus fixed! apparently the ascii art for the stegosaurus in this package was a diplodocus. thanks @stochastics !

So we'd like to stay away from ASCII art that where it's hard to tell what the thing is. Ask yourself, would most R users know what the thing is? If not, it may be useful to make the art more detailed or consider using a different piece of art.  Exceptions on a case by case basis.\n\n### Out of scope\n\n- specific people (exceptions on a case by case basis, e.g. in cowsay: rms)\n- drug references\n- profanity\n- demeaning/caricaturing any group of people\n\n### Size\n\nArt must be no bigger than the following three examples: [hypnotoad](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay/blob/main/inst/cows/hypnotoad.cow), [shark](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay/blob/main/inst/cows/shark.cow), [bat2](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay/blob/main/inst/cows/bat2.cow)\n\n### Not sure about scope?\n\nBefore opening a pull request, it's a good idea to open an issue to check if your idea is in scope.\n\n\n## Contributing code to `cowsay`\n\n1. Fork this repo\n2. Add an ascii art animal in a separate `.cow` file in `inst/cows/` - follow the other examples there, and iterate on it locally until it looks right. Be careful not to use auto-indenting in your editor on this file as it will wreck the formatting of the animals.\n3. If your animal contains non-ascii characters, it will not display properly in Windows. Please add it to the list of animals that don't work in Windows in the `@details` section in the help for the `say` function.\n4. Push back up to your fork, then send a pull request to `sckott/cowsay`.\n\nIf you want to submit an issue, then go to the [issues page](https://github.com/sckott/cowsay/issues?state=open) and do that.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sckott/cowsay/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "See [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib]\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contributing", "parent_header": ["cowsay"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sckott/cowsay/main/README.Rmd"}], "code_of_conduct": [{"result": {"value": "# Contributor Code of Conduct\n\nAs contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who \ncontribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation,\nsubmitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.\n\nWe are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for\neveryone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,\nsexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or\nimagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment,\ninsults, or other unprofessional conduct.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,\ncommits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this \nCode of Conduct.
