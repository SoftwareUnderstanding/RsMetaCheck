The highlights are:\r\n\r\n- we now support custom base images\r\n- you no longer need a service account key to submit jobs to AI Platform\r\n- we won't push anymore if a docker image already exists in Cloud, saving you some time and stdout spray\r\n- custom base images via `.calibanconfig.json`, AND support, with special base image names, for all of Google's [\"Deep Learning VMs\"](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/deep-learning-vm/docs/introduction) instead of Caliban's default base images.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ramasesh , @eschnett, @ajslone and @sagravat for their contributions on this release!\r\n\r\nFor more detail, here's the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/google/caliban/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md):\r\n\r\n- @ramasesh Added a fix that prevented `pip` git dependencies from working in\r\n  `caliban shell` mode (https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/55) This adds a\r\n  small update to the base image, so be sure to run\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker pull gcr.io/blueshift-playground/blueshift:cpu\r\ndocker pull gcr.io/blueshift-playground/blueshift:gpu\r\n```\r\n\r\nto get access to this fix.\r\n\r\n- Thanks to @eschnett, `--docker_run-args` can now deal with arbitrary\r\n  whitespace in the list of arguments, instead of single spaces only.\r\n  (https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/46)\r\n\r\n- Caliban now authenticates AI Platform job submissions using the authentication\r\n  provided by `gcloud auth login`, rather than requiring a service account key.\r\n  This significantly simplifies the setup required for a first time user.\r\n\r\n- `caliban cloud` now checks if the image exists remotely before issuing a\r\n  `docker push` command on the newly built image\r\n  (https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/36)\r\n\r\n- Big internal refactor to make it easier to work on code, increase test\r\n  coverage, add new backends (https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/32)\r\n\r\n- add `schema` validation for `.calibanconfig.json`. This makes it much easier\r\n  to add configuration knobs: https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/37\r\n\r\n- Custom base image support (https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/39), thanks\r\n  to https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/20 from @sagravat.\r\n  `.calibanconfig.json` now supports a `\"base_image\"` key. For the value, can\r\n  supply:\r\n  - a Docker base image of your own\r\n  - a dict of the form `{\"cpu\": \"base_image\", \"gpu\": \"base_image\"}` with both\r\n    entries optional, of course.\r\n\r\n  Two more cool features.\r\n\r\n  First, if you use a format string, like `\"my_image-{}:latest\"`, the format\r\n  block `{}` will be filled in with either `cpu` or `gpu`, depending on the mode\r\n  Caliban is using.\r\n\r\n  Second, we now have native support for [Google's Deep Learning\r\n  VMs](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/deep-learning-vm/docs/introduction)\r\n  as base images. The actual VM containers [live\r\n  here](https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/deeplearning-platform-release/GLOBAL).\r\n  If you provide any of the following strings, Caliban will expand them out to\r\n  the actual base image location:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndlvm:pytorch-cpu\r\ndlvm:pytorch-cpu-1.0\r\ndlvm:pytorch-cpu-1.1\r\ndlvm:pytorch-cpu-1.2\r\ndlvm:pytorch-cpu-1.3\r\ndlvm:pytorch-cpu-1.4\r\ndlvm:pytorch-gpu\r\ndlvm:pytorch-gpu-1.0\r\ndlvm:pytorch-gpu-1.1\r\ndlvm:pytorch-gpu-1.2\r\ndlvm:pytorch-gpu-1.3\r\ndlvm:pytorch-gpu-1.4\r\ndlvm:tf-cpu\r\ndlvm:tf-cpu-1.0\r\ndlvm:tf-cpu-1.13\r\ndlvm:tf-cpu-1.14\r\ndlvm:tf-cpu-1.15\r\ndlvm:tf-gpu\r\ndlvm:tf-gpu-1.0\r\ndlvm:tf-gpu-1.13\r\ndlvm:tf-gpu-1.14\r\ndlvm:tf-gpu-1.15\r\ndlvm:tf2-cpu\r\ndlvm:tf2-cpu-2.0\r\ndlvm:tf2-cpu-2.1\r\ndlvm:tf2-cpu-2.2\r\ndlvm:tf2-gpu\r\ndlvm:tf2-gpu-2.0\r\ndlvm:tf2-gpu-2.1\r\ndlvm:tf2-gpu-2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nFormat strings work here as well! So, `\"dlvm:pytorch-{}-1.4\"` is a totally valid\r\nbase image.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/caliban/tarball/0.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/caliban/zipball/0.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/google/caliban/releases/tag/0.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/caliban/releases/28915724", "release_id": 28915724, "date_created": "2020-07-24T14:05:12Z", "date_published": "2020-07-24T14:23:16Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/google/caliban/releases/27987709", "tag": "0.2.6", "name": "0.2.6: interactive progress bar support, better `stdout` handling", "author": {"name": "sritchie", "type": "User"}, "description": "This release:\r\n\r\n- Prepared for a variety of base images by setting up a cloud build matrix:\r\n  https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/25\r\n- Added better documentation for `gcloud auth configure-docker`\r\n  https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/26\r\n- Added `close()` to `TqdmFile`, preventing an error when piping `stdout`:\r\n  https://github.com/google/caliban/pull/30\r\n- `tqdm` progress bars and other interactive outputs now display correctly in\r\n  `caliban run` outputs. `stdout` flushes properly!

Excellent!\n\nPull requests and bug reports are always welcome! Check out our [Contributor's\nGuide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information on how to get started contributing to\nCaliban.\n\nThe TL;DR; is:\n\n- send us a pull request,\n- iterate on the feedback + discussion, and\n- get a +1 from a [Committer](COMMITTERS.md)\n\nin order to get your PR accepted.\n\nIssues should be reported on the [GitHub issue\ntracker](https://github.com/google/caliban/issues).\n\nIf you want to discuss an idea for a new feature or ask us a question,\ndiscussion occurs primarily in the body of [Github\nIssues](https://github.com/google/caliban/issues), though the project is growing\nlarge enough that we may start a Gitter channel soon.\n\nThe current list of active committers (who can +1 a pull request) can be found\nhere: [COMMITTERS.md](COMMITTERS.md)\n\nA list of contributors to the project can be found at the project's\n[Contributors](https://github.com/google/caliban/graphs/contributors) page.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Developing in Caliban\n\nWe use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage a series of git\npre-commit hooks for the project; for example, each time you commit code, the\nhooks will make sure that your python is formatted properly. If your code isn't,\nthe hook will format it, so when you try to commit the second time you'll get\npast the hook.\n\nAll hooks are defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. To install these hooks,\ninstall `pre-commit` if you don't yet have it. I prefer using\n[pipx](https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx) so that `pre-commit` stays globally\navailable.\n\n```bash\npipx install pre-commit\n```\n\nThen install the hooks with this command:\n\n```bash\npre-commit install\n```\n\nNow they'll run on every commit. If you want to run them manually, you can run either of these commands:\n\n```bash\npre-commit run --all-files\n\n# or this, if you've previously run `make build`:\nmake lint\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe use Sphinx to generate docs. If you want to live-preview your changes to the\ndocumentation as you are editing, you can use\n[sphinx-reload](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-reload/). To get this working:\n\n```bash\npipx install sphinx-reload\n```\n\nThen, inside the caliban folder:\n\n```bash\nmake build\nsphinx-reload docs\n```\n\nIf all goes well, `sphinx-reload` will tell you it is serving the documentation\non a port, which you can listen into from your browser.\n\n## Publishing Caliban\n\n- First, run `make build` to get your virtual environment set up.\n- Make sure that you're on the master branch!\n- add a new tag, with `git tag 0.2.3` or the equivalent\n- run `make release` to push the latest code and tags to all relevant\n  repositories.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "pyproject.toml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/pyproject.toml"}], "date_published": [{"result": {"value": "2020-06-22", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/codemeta.json"}], "identifier": [{"result": {"value": "", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/codemeta.json"}], "version": [{"result": {"value": "0.2.5", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/codemeta.json"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/tutorials/uv-metrics/hello_world.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/scripts/build_dockerfiles.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/scripts/run_tests.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "requirements": [{"result": {"value": "tensorflow-cpu", "name": "tensorflow-cpu", "version": "", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/caliban/main/tutorials/basic/requirements.txt"}, {"result": {"value": "Caliban's prequisites are [Docker](#docker) and [Python >= 3.6](#python-36).\n\nMake sure your Python is up to date:\n\n```bash\n$ python --version\nPython 3.6.9 # should be >=3.6.0\n```\n\nIf not, visit [\"Installing Python 3.6\"](#python-36) before proceeding.\n\nNext, install Caliban via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/caliban/):\n\n```bash\npip install -U caliban\n```\n\ncheck if your installation worked by navigating to an empty folder and running\n`caliban --help`.
