Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. \ud83c\udf89\n\n> And if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:\n> - Star the project\n> - Tweet about it\n> - Refer this project in your project's readme\n> - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [I Have a Question](#i-have-a-question)\n  - [I Want To Contribute](#i-want-to-contribute)\n  - [Reporting Bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n  - [Suggesting Enhancements](#suggesting-enhancements)\n  - [Your First Code Contribution](#your-first-code-contribution)\n  - [Improving The Documentation](#improving-the-documentation)\n- [Styleguides](#styleguides)\n  - [Commit Messages](#commit-messages)\n- [Join The Project Team](#join-the-project-team)\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the\n[neptoon Code of Conduct](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior\nto <>.\n\n\n## I Have a Question\n\n> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation](https://www.neptoon.org).\n\nBefore you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.\n\nIf you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/issues/new).\n- Or send an email to contact@neptoon.org\n- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.\n- Provide project and platform versions, depending on what seems relevant.\n\nWe will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n<!--\nYou might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.\n\nDepending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:\n- IRC\n- Slack\n- Gitter\n- Stack Overflow tag\n- Blog\n- FAQ\n- Roadmap\n- E-Mail List\n- Forum\n-->\n\n## I Want To Contribute\n\n> ### Legal Notice <!-- omit in toc -->\n> When contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project licence.\n\n### Reporting Bugs\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Before Submitting a Bug Report\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](https://www.neptoon.org). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).\n- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/issues?q=label%3Abug).\n- Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.\n- Collect information about the bug:\n  - Stack trace (Traceback)\n  - OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)\n  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.\n  - Possibly your input and the output\n  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?\n\n> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.\n<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->\n\nWe use GitLab issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:\n\n- Open an [Issue](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)\n- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.\n- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.\n- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.\n\n<!-- You might want to create an issue template for bugs and errors that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->\n\n\n### Suggesting Enhancements\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for neptoon, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### Before Submitting an Enhancement\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version.\n- Read the [documentation](https://www.neptoon.org) carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.\n- Perform a [search](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.\n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?\n\nEnhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitLab issues](https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon/issues).\n\n- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.\n- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.\n- You may want to **include screenshots or screen recordings** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [LICEcap](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and the built-in [screen recorder in GNOME](https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-help/stable/screen-shot-record.html.en) or [SimpleScreenRecorder](https://github.com/MaartenBaert/ssr) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->\n- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most neptoon users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.\n\n<!-- You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->\n\n### Your First Code Contribution\n\nReady to contribute code to neptoon? Follow these steps to set up your development environment and make your first contribution.\n\n#### Setting Up Your Development Environment\n\n1. **Fork the repository**\n   - Visit [gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon](https://www.gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon) (our public mirror)\n   - Click \"Fork\" to create your own copy of the repository\n\n2. **Clone your fork locally**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neptoon.git\n   cd neptoon\n   ```\n\n3. **Set up your IDE with code formatting**\n   - We use Black for code formatting\n   - **VS Code**: Install the Black Formatter extension and add to your settings.json:\n     ```json\n     {\n         \"python.defaultInterpreterPath\": \"./venv/bin/python\",\n         \"[python]\": {\n             \"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n             \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"ms-python.black-formatter\"\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n   - **Other IDEs**: Search for \"Black formatter setup\" for your preferred editor\n\n4. **Create and switch to a feature branch**\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b my-feature-name\n   ```\n   Use descriptive branch names like `fix-memory-leak` or `add-plotting-utils`\n\n5. **Set up your Python environment**\n   ```bash\n   # Using uv (recommended)\n   uv venv\n   source ./bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   uv pip install -e .\n   \n   # Or using standard pip\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -e .\n   ```\n   The `-e` flag installs in \"editable\" mode so your code changes are immediately available.\n\n6. **Create your testing workspace**\n   ```bash\n   mkdir test_dir\n   ```\n   Use `test_dir/` for personal notebooks, test scripts, and development notes. This directory is git-ignored and won't appear in your commits.\n\n7. **Verify your setup**\n   ```bash\n   python -c \"import neptoon; print('Setup successful!')\"\n   ```\n\n#### Making Your Changes\n\n- Write your code following existing patterns in the codebase\n- Add tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation if needed (see below)\n- Use `test_dir/` for experimenting and validating your changes\n\n#### Testing Your Changes\n\nBefore submitting, make sure your code works correctly:\n\n```bash\n# Run existing tests\npytest\n\n# Test your changes manually in test_dir/\npython test_dir/my_test_script.py\n```\n\n#### Updating Documentation\n\nIf your changes affect user-facing functionality, update the documentation:\n\n1. **Edit relevant markdown files** in the `docs/` folder\n2. **Add new pages** if needed and include them in `mkdocs.yml` under the `nav` section\n3. **Preview your changes locally**:\n   ```bash\n   # Install documentation dependencies\n   uv pip install -r requirements-docs.txt\n   \n   # Serve docs locally (auto-updates on save)\n   mkdocs serve\n   ```\n   Visit the local URL shown to preview your documentation changes\n\n#### Submitting Your Contribution\n\nWhen you're ready to submit:\n\n1. **Push your changes**\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Brief description of your changes\"\n   git push origin my-feature-name\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a merge request**\n   - Go to your fork on [gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon](https://gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon)\n   - Click \"Create merge request\"\n   - Target the merge request to the **public mirror** (gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon)\n\n3. **Notify the team**\n   - Send an email to contact@neptoon.org mentioning your merge request\n   - We monitor the public mirror but email ensures faster response\n\nThe maintainers will review your contribution and sync approved changes to our main development repository.\n\n### Improving The Documentation\n\nWant to improve our documentation? This guide is for contributors who want to fix typos, clarify explanations, expand descriptions, or add new documentation pages.\n\n#### Quick Setup for Documentation Changes\n\n1. **Fork and clone the repository**\n   - Visit [gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon](https://www.gitlab.com/neptoon/neptoon)\n   - Click \"Fork\" to create your own copy\n   - Clone locally:\n     ```bash\n     git clone https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/neptoon.git\n     cd neptoon\n     ```\n\n2. **Create a documentation branch**\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b improve-docs-section-name\n   ```\n\n3. **Set up local preview** (no full Python environment needed)\n   ```bash\n   # Install only documentation dependencies\n   pip install -r requirements-docs.txt\n   \n   # Start local documentation server\n   mkdocs serve\n   ```\n   This creates a local preview at `http://127.0.0.1:8000` that auto-updates when you save changes\n\n4. **Make your changes** to markdown files in the `docs/` folder\n\n5. **Submit your changes**\n   ```bash\n   git add .\n   git commit -m \"Improve documentation: brief description\"\n   git push origin improve-docs-section-name\n   ```\n   Then create a merge request on GitLab and email contact@neptoon.org\n\n#### Understanding the Documentation Structure\n\n**MKDocs Setup**\n- We use MKDocs with the Material theme\n- Configuration is controlled by `mkdocs.yml` in the root directory\n- All documentation content lives in the `docs/` folder\n\n**Navigation Structure**\n- The website menu is organized under the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml`\n- To add new pages: create a markdown file in `docs/` and add it to the `nav` section\n- Look at the existing `nav` structure and the website to understand the organisation\n\n**Local Development**\n- `mkdocs serve` creates a local server that auto-refreshes on file changes\n- Perfect for trying out styles and seeing changes immediately\n- The local URL will be shown in your terminal when you run the command\n\n#### Key Points to Remember\n\n- **Markdown format**: All documentation uses standard Markdown with MKDocs Material extensions\n- **Structure matters**: Check that your changes fit logically with the existing navigation and content flow\n\n#### When to Contribute Documentation\n\n- **Clarification**: When existing docs are unclear or confusing\n- **Completeness**: When you notice missing information or examples\n- **Accuracy**: When you find outdated or incorrect information\n- **Accessibility**: When content could be more beginner-friendly\n\nFor questions about documentation contributions, reach out to contact@neptoon.org\n\n\n## Join The Project Team\n\nDrop an email to contact@neptoon.org \n\n<!-- omit in toc -->\n## Attribution\nThis guide is based on the

Install\n\nFor users familiar with Python, neptoon can be installed directly using pip:\n\n```\npip install neptoon\n```\n\nFor those who are not familiar with python, use `pipx` for installation (described below).\n\n## Recommended Installation\n\nWe recommend installing neptoon in a dedicated environment to ensure reproducibility and prevent package conflicts. Below we show installing with python 3.11 but you do not need to stick to this, as long as you use >= Python 3.10\n\nHere some example scripts to do this using mamba or conda:\n\n=== \"Mamba\"\n    ```bash\n    # Create a new environment with Python 3.11\n    mamba create -n neptoon python=3.11 ipykernel\n    # Activate the environment\n    mamba activate neptoon\n    # Install neptoon\n    pip install neptoon\n    ```\n=== \"Conda\"\n    ```bash\n    # Create a new environment with Python 3.11\n    conda create -n neptoon python=3.11 ipykernel\n    # Activate the environment\n    conda activate neptoon\n    # Install neptoon\n    pip install neptoon\n    ```\n=== \"uv\"\n    ```bash\n    # Create a new environment with Python 3.11\n    uv venv neptoon --python 3.11\n    # Activate the environment\n    source ./bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS\n    # or\n    .\\Scripts\\activate     # On Windows\n    # Install neptoon\n    uv pip install neptoon\n    ```\n\n!!! tip \"Jupyter Integration\"\n    The ipykernel package is included to enable using neptoon in Jupyter notebooks, which is particularly useful for interactive data analysis and visualization. For example when working through the [examples](neptoon-examples.md). Leave this out if you don't need it.\n\n## Using pipx to install neptoon \n\nFor those who do not regularly use python, and who plan to mostly use the Command Line Interface (CLI) or Graphical User Interface (GUI), setting up things like python environments might feel alien. Thankfully there is a simple system known as `pipx` which allows you to easily install python packages without needing to worry about managing environments. It makes things simple to launch from your terminal/powershell.\n\n### Install pipx on your system\n\nHere is how we can install `pipx` on your system. \n\n=== \"Windows\"\n    ```powershell\n    # Install pipx\n    python -m pip install --user pipx\n    python -m pipx ensurepath\n    ```\n\n=== \"Unix/macOS\"\n    ```bash\n    # Install pipx\n    python3 -m pip install --user pipx\n    python3 -m pipx ensurepath\n    ```\n\n!!! note \"Important\"\n    After installation, you'll need to restart your terminal/powershell for the changes to take effect.\n\n\n## CLI Installation Guide\n\nIf you want to use the command line interface to process your sites it is recommended to install neptoon using pipx. This means you have access to CLI commands in your terminal/shell. \n\n```bash\npipx install neptoon\n```\n\n\n### Update neptoon with pipx\n\nWhen new versions of neptoon are pushed to pip (you can see what the latest version on pip is [here](https://pypi.org/project/neptoon/)), you might want to update your CLI version on your host machine. To do that run:\n\n```bash\npipx install neptoon --force\n```\n\n### Uninstall neptoon with pipx\n \nIf you need to remove neptoon from your system:\n\n```bash\npipx uninstall neptoon\n```\n\n## GUI Installation Guide\n\n!!! info \"**Work in Progress**\"\n    The GUI is now available as of v0.6.0 to be installed locally. This is still a work in progress, and should be considered in a beta phase. Updates coming in the future.\n\n\nNeptoon provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables researchers and practitioners to process Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor data without requiring Python programming expertise. This guide walks you through the installation and initial setup process for those users who expect to only need the GUI.\n\n### 1. Install neptoon\n\nOnce pipx is installed and your terminal has been restarted, install neptoon using:\n\n```bash\npipx install \"neptoon[gui]\"\n```\n\nThis command will:\n\n- Downloads the latest stable version of neptoon\n- Creates an isolated environment for the application\n- Installs all necessary dependencies\n\nSame as above - if you want to update neptoon within pipx you just need to run:\n\n```bash\npipx install \"neptoon[gui]\" --force\n```\n\n### 2. Launch the GUI\n\n```bash\nneptoon-gui\n```\n\nWhen you execute this command:\n\n- A local server will start automatically\n- The launcher should automatically start in a browser window\n- Your terminal will also display a URL (typically http://localhost:8501)\n- You can copy this URL and open it in your web browser\n\n\n## Development Version Installation\n\nIf you want to install the latests features (before they have been fully tested and integrated) you might want to install the development version of neptoon using:\n\n```\npip install git+https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/cosmos/neptoon.git@development\n```\n\n!!! warning \"Warning\"\n    We provide this as an option but would not recommend this for production ready data processing. The development branch is always in flux and so bugs might be present!\n\n\n## Using Docker for the GUI (recommended)\n\n1. Install Docker ()\n2. run this command: `docker run -p 8501:8501 dpower101/neptoon-gui:latest`\n3. Terminal will provide some links - open the one called `http://localhost:8501` in your browser\n4.
