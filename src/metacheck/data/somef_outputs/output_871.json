was developed to support seismic simulations run on high-performance computing systems, so it is designed to compile and run on Linux-based computers. Before installing UCVM, they should be aware that there are several ways to get access to UCVM without installing the software on your own Linux computer. Below we outline several of the options:\n1. [SCEC UCVM Web viewer](http://moho.scec.org/UCVM_web/web/viewer.php) Users can query UCVM velocity models, without installing UCVM, using the UCVM website. \n2. [UCVM Docker Images](https://github.com/sceccode/ucvm_docker) Users can run UCVM in Docker on their local computers including laptops. Users can install free Docker software on most computers (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) then run an UCVM Docker image in a terminal window on their computer. \n3. [Installation Instructions for Linux Systems](https://github.com/SCECcode/ucvm/wiki/How-to-Guides) User can install UCVM on Linux system. Advanced users that want to install many of the UCVM models, or that want to run large parallel queries of the CVM models, should install the UCVM software on a Linux system. UCVM software is developed on USC Center for Advanced Research Computing (CARC) Linux cluster which provide MPI libraries. The UCVM software framework has several MPI-based executables. These executables are built using the automake system if the required MPI libraries are found in the installation computing environment. \n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Installation", "parent_header": ["The Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) Software"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCECcode/ucvm/main/README.md"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "Once installed, UCVM provides an executable program, called ucvm_query, that implements a query interface to multiple seismic velocity models.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Usage", "parent_header": ["The Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) Software"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCECcode/ucvm/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "'ucvm_query' is the basic UCVM interface that queries velocity model of interest.\n\n<pre>\n$ ucvm_query -f /usr/local/opt/ucvm/conf/ucvm.conf -m cvmh -l 33.84007,-117.95683,0.0\n</pre>\nreturns\n<pre>\n -117.9568    33.8401      0.000     34.438    293.500       cvmh   1238.170    120.690   1450.659       none      0.000      0.000      0.000      crust   1238.170    120.690   1450.65\n</pre>\n\nThe results are in a column oriented format.

The contributions of each model are shown in columns 5-8 and 10-12, but the combined results returned in 14-16 are typically used by modelers.\n\nDetailed descriptions of the UCVM return parameters are listed in this UCVM parameter summary provided in the [UCVM documentation](https://github.com/sceccode/ucvm/wiki).\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/sceccode/ucvm/wiki/reference\"><img src=\"https://github.com/sceccode/ucvm/wiki/images/UCVM_Query_Params.png\" width=\"300\"></a>\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "ucvm_query", "parent_header": ["The Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) Software", "Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCECcode/ucvm/main/README.md"}], "support": [{"result": {"value": "Support for UCVM is provided by the Statewide California Earthquake Center (SCEC) Research Computing Group.
