Below is a brief list of the major improvements and modifications included in this release of the Broadband Platform since version 19.4.0:\r\n* Included multi-segment rupture support for GP, SDSU, Irikura 1, Irikura 2, and Song simulation methods. Currently provided multi-segment validation events are Landers, Ridgecrest 19C, and San Simeon.\r\n* Updated GP low-frequency module (jbsim) to perform time-shifting in the time domain instead of frequency domain. This avoids calculating numerous FFTs and results in a significant processing speedup of 10x, and benefits all simulation modules that use the GP low-frequency code.\r\n* Modified UCSB simulation method to include support for double corner frequency (DCF)\r\n* Included FAS validation module that produces FAS Goodness-of-Fitness plots, for a better seismological interpretation of the results. This is in addition to the PSA validation that is the main metric for design in engineering.\r\n* Added Green's Functions and validation events for the Southern Walker Lane region (Southern Sierra Nevada) of California. Validation events include the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence.\r\n* Expanded the GP GoF module to include a Vs30 GoF plot (similar to the distance and map GoF plots) that can be used to show GoF bias related to stations' Vs30s.\r\n* Updated the GP rupture generator to genslip-5.5.2 and the high-frequency code to hb_high_6.0.5.\r\n\r\nAll new Broadband Platform users should work with this new version of the Broadband Platform. Existing BBP users are encouraged to upgrade to this latest release of the SCEC Broadband Platform, unless they need to reproduce results produced by a previous version.

Below is a summary of the improvements and modifications included in this release of the Broadband Platform.\r\n\r\n#### Method Updates\r\n\r\n* Added the Irikura Recipe Method 2 simulation method to the Broadband Platform. It uses the same rupture generator as the Irikura Recipe Method 1, developed by Arben Pitarka, followed by the GP low-frequency wave propagation code. It then uses a high-frequency module developed by NIED.\r\n\r\n* Both Song and Irikura Recipe Method 1 methods now support multi-segment ruptures. These two methods create a version 2.0 SRF file that can be used directly by the GP wave propagation codes and allows a single Broadband Platform simulation to include all segments from a multi-plane rupture.\r\n\r\n* Used the GP site response module in all California and Japan validation events.\r\n\r\n* Upgraded the SDSU BBToolbox package to version 2.1, with time-domain merging of LF and HF seismograms.\r\n\r\n* Re-calculated Greens Functions for California and Japan using 500m/s as reference Vs, bringing the computed synthetic seismograms closer to site conditions and requiring smaller corrections by the site amplification module.\r\n\r\n#### Other Improvements\r\n\r\n* Updated the GP rupture generator to genslip-5.4.1 and the GP high-frequency code to hb_high_6.0.3.\r\n\r\n* Added Green's Functions and validation events for the Central coast region of California.\r\n\r\n* Extended the GP site response module so it can work with all 7 simulation methods.\r\n\r\n* Upgraded cluster simulation scripts for use with the Slurm job scheduler.

Below is a summary of the improvements and modifications includes in this release of the Broadband Platform.\r\n\r\n#### Method Updates\r\n\r\n* Added the Irikura Recipe Method 1 simulation method to the Broadband Platform. It includes a new rupture generator module developed by Arben Pitarka to generate a SRF file. Then, it uses the GP method wave propagation codes to generate low- and high-frequency seismograms.\r\n\r\n* Updated GP rupture generator code to genslip-5.2.2. This new version of genslip accepts three new parameters used for the simulation of multi-segment ruptures, where time series can be generated segment by segment and then added together before post-processing is done.\r\n\r\n* Updated GP match.py module to improve the merging of low- and high-frequency seismograms.\r\n\r\n#### General Improvements\r\n\r\n* Added a FAS calculation module to the Platform. Work contributed by Jeff Bayless using David Boore's 'smc2fs2' and 'asc2smc' codes. The FAS module produces per-station plots with both N/S and E/W components, along with the smoothed EAS (effective amplitude spectrum) of the two horizontal components.\r\n\r\n* Included the calculation of zeta parameter in the RZZ2015 module.\r\n\r\n* Added the Central United States simulation region, contributed by Mehrdad Hosseini and Paul Somerville. This includes a new set of Green's functions, calculated up to 1800km.\r\n\r\n* Fixed issue in the Anderson GoF and RZZ2015 codes that was causing time series to not align correctly. Thanks to Kim Olsen and Rumi Takedatsu for reporting this bug.\r\n\r\n* Added two new scripts: 'merge_multisegment_validation.py' and 'merge_multisegment_scenario.py' to the utils/misc directory. These scripts can be used to combine time series from a number of separately-calculated segments, allowing for a multi-segment rupture to be simulated.\r\n\r\n#### Cluster Improvements\r\n\r\n* bbp_hpcc_validation.py and bbp_hpcc_scenario.py include option for user to override default walltime. This allows users to specify a short walltime if they know a job will run quickly, allowing the job to be potentially quickly scheduled by PBS.\r\n\r\n* Added a '-s' option to both bbp_hpcc_validation.py and bbp_hpcc_scenario.py to enable the use of the site response module. Currently only the GP site response module is supported (it is used for all methods).\r\n\r\n* Several modifications to the cluster scripts to enable multi-segment ruptures to be simulated. Added a '--segment' option to specify the segment number, a '--variation' option to enable the use of different sets of random seeds in the cluster. Also added a '--firstsegment' option to enable the scripts to find the first segment of a multi-segment run so that common seeds can be used for certain parameters across multiple segments (used by the GP method).\r\n\r\n* Cluster scripts now save metadata file on top-level simulation directory including all command-line options used to generate the cluster simulation. This is useful to track simulation parameters.\r\n\r\n* Added two scripts, 'bbp_merge_multisegment_validation.py' and 'bbp_merge_multisegment_scenario.py' to the utils/batch directory. These scripts work similarly to the ones in utils/misc but can be used to calculate multi-segment runs using segments calculated on the cluster.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SCECcode/bbp/tarball/17.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SCECcode/bbp/zipball/17.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/SCECcode/bbp/releases/tag/17.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/SCECcode/bbp/releases/6341326", "release_id": 6341326, "date_created": "2017-06-16T22:31:47Z", "date_published": "2017-06-16T22:32:20Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "# Contributing to the SCEC Broadband Platform (BBP) System\n\nThis document provides an overview on how to contribute to BBP, and will provide step-by-step instructions on a practical contribution workflow.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n* Make sure you have an active GitHub account\n* Download and install git\n* Read the git documentation\n* Install the main branch of the SCECcode/bbp.git repository\n* If you haven't worked with Git Forks before, make sure to read the documentation linked below.\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request\n\nPull requests are great!

"Installing the Broadband Platform involves obtaining a copy of the code and building the required executables. You can either download the tar.gz platform from BBP's GitHub releases page or check the code out of GitHub directly.\n\n### Software Dependencies\n\nThe Broadband Platform has the following software dependencies in order to compile and run:\n\n* Python v3.6.7+ with\n  * Matplotlib 3.3.0+\n  * NumPy 1.18.5+\n  * SciPy 1.4.1+\n  * Pyproj 2.6.1+\n  * Numba 0.55.2+\n* GNU compilers (gcc, gfortran) 8.3+\n  * FFTW library 3.3.8\n\nPlease make sure they are installed in your computer before you continue with the BBP installation process. Depending on the specific NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib versions users installed in their systems, they may experience certain \"Future Warning\" messages while running the BBP. In this case, upgrading NumPy, SciPy, and/or Matplotlib will usually make the warning messages disappear. We used the package versions listed above to run the Unit and Acceptance tests.\n\n### Easy Installation\n\nMost users will want to use the easy installation procedure described below to install the Broadband Platform to their systems. We recommend that users that want to use the Broadband Platform download the tar.gz file available on GitHub's release page. For advanced users, who would like to make modifications to the BBP and contribute these modifications back to us, we recommend they clone our repository so that it is easier to track their changes to the software.\n\nTo install the Broadband Platform on your computer using the easy installation script, please follow these steps:\n\n* Create a directory on your computer where you want all Broadband packages to be installed:\n\n```\n  $ cd /home/sarah\n  $ mkdir bbp\n  $ cd /home/sarah/bbp\n```\n\nThen, users can use one of the two method below to obtain a copy of the Broadband Platform software distribution:\n\n#### Downloading the tar file from GitHub\n\nAs mentioned above, one option to obtain the Broadband Platform source distribution is to download a release 'tar.gz' or 'zip' file directly from GitHub's releases page.\n\n* Download the .tar.gz file from GitHub's releases page into the recently-created directory\n* Uncompress the downloaded file\n\n```\n  $ tar -xzf bbp-22.4.0.tar.gz\n```\n\n* Delete the tar.gz file as it will not be needed anymore (optional)\n\n#### Cloning the Broadband repository from GitHub\n\nAnother option is for users to clone the Broadband repository from GitHub using the following command:\n\n```\n $ git clone https://github.com/SCECcode/bbp.git bbp-22.4.0\n```\n\nEither way, after one of the steps above users should have the Broadband Platform source distribution downloaded into their computers. Then, the next steps are:\n\n* Run the easy installation script located in the setup sub-directory.\n\n```\n  $ cd bbp-22.4.0/setup\n  $ ./easy_install_bbp_22.4.0.sh\n```\n\nThe easy installation script will create a number of other directories inside your top-level bbp directory (/home/sarah/bbp). It will compile the codes in the BBP source distribution, and it will then ask the user which BBP packages should be installed. Each package contains a region (e.g. LA Basin, Northern California, etc). The user should select 1 (Yes) to install the package, or 2 (No) to skip it. Please note that the LA Basin region is required for running the Unit and Acceptance tests provided with the Broadband Platform.\n\nAfter asking the user about each of the 6 available regions, the easy install script will download and install of these regions. This process can take a while (possibly several hours) when users select several simulation regions. At the end of the installation process, the script will print a number of commands that should be inserted in the user's .bash_profile file. In the example above, you will see an output like:\n\n```\n=> All Done!\n\nPlease add the following lines to your bash_profile:\n\nexport BBP_DIR=/home/sarah/bbp/bbp-19.4.0/bbp\nexport BBP_GF_DIR=/home/sarah/bbp/bbp_gf\nexport BBP_VAL_DIR=/home/sarah/bbp/bbp_val\nexport PYTHONPATH=/home/sarah/bbp/bbp-19.4.0/bbp/comps\nexport BBP_DATA_DIR=/home/sarah/bbp/bbp_data\nexport PATH=/home/sarah/bbp/bbp-19.4.0/bbp/comps:/home/sarah/bbp/bbp-19.4.0/bbp/utils/batch:$PATH\nulimit -s unlimited\n```\n\nAfter installing the Broadband Platform on their systems, users should confirm the code is built correctly by [running Unit and Acceptance Tests](./Running-Tests) before starting to use the code for research purposes.\n\n\n### Using a User Response File\nIf you are performing repeated installations, you may want to put the required inputs into a file and run the installation as a script, something like the following:\n\nCreate install_inputs.txt containing these lines:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nThen, in bbp setup directory: (e.g. /home/scec-00/maechlin/bbp/bbp/setup)\n\n./easy_install_bbp_22.4.0.sh < install_all_inputs.txt &> install_results.log &\n\nThis will run the installation in the background without any users interactions, and will write stdout and error messages to the install_results.log file.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SCECcode/bbp/main/doc/Installation.md"}, {"result": {"value": "BBP was developed to support ground simulations run on Linux servers and high-performance computing systems,\nso it is designed to compile and run on Linux-based computers.

[BBP Docker Images](https://github.com/sceccode/bbp_docker) Users can run a version of BBP using Docker on their\nlocal computers including laptops. The BBP Docker version contains an LA-Basin region velocity model, and three validation events in that regeion.\nUsers can install free Docker software on most computers (e.g. Linux, MacOS, Windows) then run a BBP Docker image in a terminal window on their computer.\n2. [Installation Instructions for Linux Systems](https://github.com/SCECcode/bbp/wiki/Installation)\nAdvanced users that want to install many or all of the BBP simulation regions models, or that want to run large\nparallel queries of the CVM models, should install the BBP software on a Linux system.
