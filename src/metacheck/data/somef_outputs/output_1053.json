User code relaying on reexported pipe `%>%`\r\n  from `osmdata` must explicitly load it with `library(magrittr)`.\r\n  Code examples, tests and vignettes now use the pipe from base (`|>`) available since R 4.1 (#361)\r\n- `getbb(..., format_out = \"polygon\")` return polygons following [https://www.ogc.org/standards/sfa/].\r\n  Polygons are defined by a list of matrices of coordinates. The first ring defines the exterior boundary, and the following rings define holes if present.\r\n  Also fix `getbb(..., format_out = \"sf_polygon\")` returning each (multi)polygon as a row in an `sf` object. \r\n  Before, every ring was an independent polygon, even for holes or multipolygons,\r\n  and for `format_out = \"sf_polygon\"`, the features were split in a list with polygons in one item and multipolygons in another (#378).\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\n- Implemented `c.osmdata_sc` method to join `osmdata_sc` objects (#333)\r\n- Depends on R >= 4.1 to use the base pipe (`|>`) in examples and vignettes (#371)\r\n- Deprecate `nodes_only` argument in `opq()`. Superseded by argument `osm_types` (#370)\r\n- Deprecate `osmdata_sp` (#372)\r\n- Pre-prend class names `osmdata_sf` and `osmdata` rather than append; thanks to @agila5 (#373)\r\n- Add `osmadata_data.frame` class to `osmdata_data_frame()` results (#378)\r\n- Reimplement `trim_osmdata()` using `sf` instead of `sp`. Now, it checks the full geometry instead of just the points\r\n  to determine if an object is properly contained in the bbox (only for `osmdata_sf` objects, `osdmata_sc` still wrong) (#382).\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n\r\n- Improved `get_bb(..., format_out = \"sf_polygon\")` to return full metadata\r\n  along with geometries (#338 thanks to @RegularnaMatrica)\r\n- Mention key-only feature requests in README (#342 thanks to @joostschouppe)\r\n- Merge any columns in `osmdata_sf()` with mixed-case duplicated names (#348)\r\n- Set encoding to UTF-8 for tags and user names (#347)\r\n- Document the use of the input query as character strings for `osmdata_*()` (#349)\r\n- Consistent `NA` values throughout all multi-* matrices returned by `osmdata_sf()` (#355)\r\n- Fix dates and remove `lubridate` from imports (#360)\r\n- Restructure class definitions of `osmdata_sf()` and `osmdata_sc()` objects (#373, #374)\r\n- Revert added `osmdata` class to `osmdata_data_frame()` and `osmdata_sc()` + \r\n  Fix docs to better represent classes accepted by `trim_osmdata()`, `osm_poly2line()` and extract function (#380)\r\n- Use `terra` functions instead of `raster` (obsolete) in `osm_elevation()` (#383)\r\n- @jmaspons  is the new maintainer (#384).\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/osmdata/tarball/v0.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/osmdata/zipball/v0.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/osmdata/releases/tag/v0.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/osmdata/releases/242116175", "release_id": 242116175, "date_created": "2025-08-22T13:27:49Z", "date_published": "2025-08-24T18:08:13Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/osmdata/releases/117278246", "tag": "v0.2.5", "name": "CRAN version 0.2.5", "author": {"name": "mpadge", "type": "User"}, "description": "0.2.5\r\n===================\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\n- v0.2.4 was removed without notice from CRAN because of #329;

If you haven't done this before,\nthere's a nice overview of git [here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html), as well\nas best practices for submitting pull requests\n[here](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html#pr-make).\n\nThe `osmdata` coding style diverges somewhat from [this commonly used R style\nguide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), primarily in the following two ways,\nboth of which improve code readability: (1) All curly braces are vertically\naligned:\n\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n{\n    x <- 1\n}\n```\nand **not**\n```r\nthis <- function(){\n    x <- 1\n}\n```\nand (2) Also highlighted in that code is the additional whitespace which\npermeates `osmdata` code. Words of text are separated by whitespace, and so\ncode words should be too:\n```r\nthis <- function1 (function2 (x))\n```\nand **not**\n```r\nthis <- function1(function2(x))\n```\nwith the natural result that one ends up writing\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n```\nwith a space between `function` and `()`. That's it.\n\nYou can use `precommit::use_precommit()` to enforce this style with git commit \nhooks as defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. The first commit can be slow\nbecause the hooks have to be compiled and installed. To commit ignoring hooks,\n`git commit --no-verify`, or shortened version, `git commit -n`.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nTo refresh the `README.md` file after modifying `README.Rmd`, use:\n```r\ndevtools::build_readme(output_format=\"md_document\")\n```\n\nWhen updating the package dependencies in `DESCRIPTION` or other metadata,\nrefresh `codemeta.json`:\n```r\ncodemetar::write_codemeta()\n```\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe want to encourage a warm, welcoming, and safe environment for contributing to\nthis project. See the [code of\nconduct](https://github.com/ropensci/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for\nmore information.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration",
