religion, or sexual identity and\norientation.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\n\n-   Using welcoming and inclusive language\n-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n-   Focusing on what is best for the community\n-   Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n-   Public or private harassment\n-   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable\nbehavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\nreject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions\nthat are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or\npermanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,\nthreatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be\nfurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported by contacting the project team at products@grycap.upv.es. All\ncomplaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that\nis deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is\nobligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.\nFurther details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good\nfaith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other\nmembers of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 1.4, available at\n[http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/main/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/main/docker/buildAndPush.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "docpage", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/main/docpage/package.json"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "package.json", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/main/docpage/package.json"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/interTwin-eu/dcnios/tree/main/docpage/docs", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "commandline-application", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 0.82, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "1.
