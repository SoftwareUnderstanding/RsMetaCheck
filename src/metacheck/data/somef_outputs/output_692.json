"contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "# Contributing to universe\n\nThis outlines how to propose a change to universe.\n\n## Fixing typos\n\nYou can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, \nas long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. \nThis generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. \nYou can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n## Bigger changes\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s needed. \nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, \nplease file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) \n(this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).\nSee the tidyverse guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.\n\n### Dependencies installation\n\nTo install all dependencies of universe, including dependencies needed for development, call, from the root of the runiverse Git repository:\n\n```r\n# All Imports and Suggests dependencies\npak::pak()\n# Then install packages like roxygen2 add-ons\npak::pak(dependencies = \"Config/Needs/build\")\n```\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. \n    If you haven't done this before, you can use `usethis::create_from_github(\"ropenscilabs/runiverse\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `pak::pak()` and `pak::pak(dependencies = \"Config/Needs/build\")`, \n    and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). \n    You can use [usethis](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/pr-functions.html), GitHub Desktop, etc.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), \n   with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), \n   for documentation. \n   We aspire to document internal functions using [devtag](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/devtag) (not all of them are thus documented yet).\n\n*  We use [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/) for unit tests and [httptest2](https://books.ropensci.org/http-testing/httptest2.html). \n   Please add test cases for the change you are proposing, or ask us for help.\n   \n### Test files\n\nWe strive to align script and test names. \nThe goal is to have code from `R/name.R` tested in `tests/testthat/test-name.R`.\nThis allows easy toggling between the two files thanks to `usethis::use_test()` and `usethis::use_r()`.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the universe project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct). \nBy contributing to this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":
