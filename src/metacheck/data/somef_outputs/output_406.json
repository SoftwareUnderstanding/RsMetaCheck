No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\ncommunity.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0,\navailable at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/\ncode_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"pachamaltese/lsts\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependences with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the lsts project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
