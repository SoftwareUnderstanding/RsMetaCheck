For trees of modest size and\nstatistical methods that don't require *too* many traversals, there a lot of\ngreat options. If you're working with about a thousand taxa or less, you should\nbe able to use any of those packages for your tree. \nHowever, if you are working with trees that include tens of thousands, or\nperhaps millions of taxa, you will run into problems. `ete3`, `dendropy`,\n`toytree`, and`scikit-bio`'s `TreeNode` are all designed to give you\nlots of flexibility. You can re-root trees, use different traversal\nschemes, attach metadata to nodes, attach and detach nodes, splice\nsub-trees into or out of the main tree, plot trees for publication\nfigures and do lots of other useful things. That power and flexibility\ncomes with a price : speed. \nFor trees of moderate size, it is sometimes possible to solve the speed issue\nby working with a matrix representation of the tree. Unfortunately, these\nrepresentations scale quadratically with the number of taxa in the tree.  For\nexample, the distance matrix for a tree of 100,000 taxa contains 10,000,000,000\nelements, which will consume about 20GB of RAM. If your method performs\nsampling on this matrix then almost every operation will be a cache miss.\nUnless you are very clever about access patterns and matrix layout, the\nperformance will be limited by RAM latency, leaving the CPU mostly idle. SuchTree\nis designed to solve this problem by representing trees as a highly compact\nobject that usually fits into the CPU's L3 cache even for very large trees,\nand employs simple, assembly-language code paths for accessing data. Please\nsee the [Benchmarks](docs/benchmarks.md) for a more detailed look at performance.\n \n", "original_header": "High-performance sampling of very large trees"}, "confidence": 0.9852412168992011, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryneches/SuchTree/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "`SuchLinkedTrees` has you covered.

It\nwill let you subset the graphs using their phylogenetic or ecological\nproperties. It will generate weighted adjacency and Laplacian matrixes of the\nwhole graph or of subgraphs you have selected. It will generate spectral\ndecompositions of subgraphs if spectral graph theory is your thing. \nAnd, if that doesn't solve your problem, it will emit sugraphs as `Graph`\nobjects for use with the [`igraph`](http://igraph.org/) network analysis\npackage, or node and edge data for building graphs in \n[`networkx`](https://networkx.github.io/).

"`SuchTree` depends on the following packages :\n\n* `scipy`\n* `numpy`\n* `dendropy`\n* `cython`\n* `pandas`\n\nTo install the current release, you can install from PyPI :\n\n```\npip install SuchTree\n```\n\nIf you install using `pip`, binary packages\n([`wheels`](https://realpython.com/python-wheels/)) are available for CPython\n3.9, 3.10 and 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 on Linux x86_64 and on MacOS with Intel and\nApple silicon. If your platform isn't in that list, but it is supported by\n[`cibuildwheel`](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel), please file an issue to\nrequest your platform! I would be absolutely _delighted_ to help you get\n`SuchTree` deployed on an exotic embedded system or a mainframe.\n\nTo install the most recent development version :\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ryneches/SuchTree.git\ncd SuchTree\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install .\n```\n\nTo install via conda, first make sure you've got the\n[bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) channel set up, if you haven't already :\n\n```\nconda config --add channels bioconda\nconda config --add channels conda-forge\nconda config --set channel_priority strict\n```\n\nThen, install in the usual way :\n\n```\nconda install suchtree\n```\n\n**Note that the conda package name is lower case!**\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Installation"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryneches/SuchTree/main/README.md"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "`SuchTree` will accept URLs, file paths or valid NEWICK strings :\n\n```python\nfrom SuchTree import SuchTree\n\nT = SuchTree( 'test.tree' )\nT = SuchTree( 'https://github.com/ryneches/SuchTree/blob/master/data/gopher-louse/gopher.tree' )\nT = SuchTree( '(A,B,(C,D));' )\n```\n\nIf you are just starting out, begin with the [Working\nExample](docs/examples/SuchTree_examples.md).

The API Reference is generated\nautomatically after each commit; it's guaranteed to be up-to-date, but not\nnecessarily fun to read. \n\nI highly recommend using SuchTree with [`toytree`](https://eaton-lab.org/toytree/)\nfor visualizing trees.
