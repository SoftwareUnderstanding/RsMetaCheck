In return,\nthey should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing\npatches and features.\n\n## Using the issue tracker\n\nThe [issue\ntracker](https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/issues)\nis the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [features\nrequests](#features) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), but\nplease respect the following restrictions:\n\n* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for personal support requests\n  (contact directly the authors\n  [tfel-contact@cea.fr](mailto:tfel-contact@cea.fr)\n\n## Bug reports\n\nA bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.\nGood bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!\n\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\n1. **Use the GitHub issue search**: check if the issue has already been\n   reported.\n\n2. **Check if the issue has been fixed**: try to reproduce it using the\n   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.\n\n3. **Isolate the problem**: ideally create a [reduced test\n   case].\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more\ninformation. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. What is\nyour environment? What steps will reproduce the issue? What compiler(s) and OS\nexperience the problem? What would you expect to be the outcome? All these\ndetails will help people to fix any potential bugs.\n\nExample:\n\n> Short and descriptive example bug report title\n>\n> A summary of the issue, versions of `TFEL/MFront` used and the\n> OS/compiler environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the\n> steps required to reproduce the bug.\n>\n> 1. This is the first step\n> 2. This is the second step\n> 3. Further steps, etc.\n>\n> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being\n> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as\n> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their\n> merits).\n\n## Feature requests\n\nFeature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea\nfits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong\ncase to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Please\nprovide as much detail and context as possible.\n\n## Pull requests\n\nGood pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic\nhelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated\ncommits.\n\n**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.\nimplementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),\notherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the\nproject's developers might not want to merge into the project.\n\nPlease adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project (indentation,\naccurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).\n\nAdhering to the following this process is the best way to get your work\nincluded in the project:\n\n1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,\n   and configure the remotes:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\n   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport.git\n   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory\n   cd MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport\n   # Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\n   git remote add upstream https://github.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport.git\n   ```\n\n2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout master\n   git pull upstream master\n   ```\n\n3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to\n   contain your feature, change, or fix:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit\n   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)\n   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's\n   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)\n   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.\n\n5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:\n\n   ```bash\n   git pull [--rebase] upstream master\n   ```\n\n6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push origin <topic-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n7.

It uses those values to create \na `Makefile` in each directory of the package.  It may also create one\nor more `.h` files containing system-dependent definitions..\n\nThe simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n  `cmake .` to configure the package for your system. This will build\n  `MGIS` in place.\n\n   However, we strongly recommend building `MGIS` out of the source\n   tree as follows:\n   \n   - Create a `build` directory et go in this directory\n   - Call `cmake <path_to_MGIS_SOURCES>` to configure the directory\n\n   Useful options are listed below.\n\n   Running `cmake` takes awhile.  While running, it prints some\n   messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n2. Type `make` to compile the package.\n\n3. Optionally, type `make check` to run any self-tests that come with\n  the package.\n\n4. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and\n  documentation.\n\n5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source\n  code directory by typing `make clean`.\n\nOptions\n=======\n\n- `enable-c-bindings`: compiles the `C` bindings (default=OFF)\n- `enable-fortran-bindings`: compiles bindings for the `Fortran2003`\n  language (default=OFF)\n- `enable-python-bindings`: compiles the `Python` bindings. This requires\n  the `pybind11` library to be available (default=OFF)\n- `enable-fenics-bindings`: compiles the `FEniCS` bindings. Those\n  bindings are experimental and very limited.

Building from source\nrequires `cmake` to be installed (<https://cmake.org/>).\n\n## Overview\n\nThe simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n1. `cd` to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n  `cmake .` to configure the package for your system. This will build\n  `MGIS` in place.\n\n   However, we strongly recommend building `MGIS` out of the source\n   tree as follows:\n   \n   - Create a `build` directory et go in this directory\n   - Call `cmake <path_to_MGIS_SOURCES>` to configure the directory\n\n   Useful options are listed below.\n\n   Running `cmake` takes awhile.  While running, it prints some\n   messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n2. Type `make` to compile the package.\n\n3. Optionally, type `make check` to run any self-tests that come with\n  the package.\n\n4. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and\n  documentation.\n\n5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the source\n  code directory by typing `make clean`.\n\n## Options\n\n- `enable-c-bindings`: compiles the `C` bindings (default=OFF)\n- `enable-fortran-bindings`: compiles bindings for the `Fortran2003`\n  language (default=OFF)\n- `enable-python-bindings`: compiles the `Python` bindings. This requires\n  the `Boost/Python` library to be available (default=OFF)\n- `enable-fenics-bindings`: compiles the `FEniCS` bindings. Those\n  bindings are experimental and very limited. To use `MGIS` with\n  `FEniCS`, usage of the `Python` bindings are encouraged.\n- `enable-julia-bindings`: compiles the `Julia` bindings. This requires\n  the `CxxWrap` library to be available.\n- `enable-website`: generate the TFEL website (enabled by default if\n  pandoc is found)\n- `enable-portable-build`: do not use processor specific flags.\n- `enable-static`: compiles static libraries\n- `enable-doxygen-doc`: enable the generation of the API documentation\n  using with `Doxygen`.\n\nBy default, the library tries to autodetect the TFEL libraries and\nexpects that a working version of TFEL is available in the\nenvironnement. The `disable-tfel` option can be used to disable this\nfeature. The `TFEL_DIR` variable can be passed to `cmake` to help the\ndetection of the `TFEL` libraries: it must points to the `cmake` files\ngenerated by the `TFEL` project.\n\n## `cmake` usefull variables\n\n- `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`           : two values are supported `Release` and `Debug`\n- `CASTEM_INSTALL_PATH`        : specify where the castem has been installed\n- `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`       : specify a tool chain file\n- `Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS` : select the `python` version to\n  \t\t\t         use. Note that only the major and minor\n  \t\t\t         version of python shall be passed, not\n  \t\t\t         the revision version or the detection\n  \t\t\t         fails.\n\n# Installing using `spack`\n\n`spack` is flexible package manager (https://spack.io/).\n\nInstalling `mgis` using `spack` shall be as easy as:\n\n~~~~{.bash}\n$ spack install mgis\n~~~~\n\nBy default, the `c`, `python` and `fortran` bindings are installed. The\nmgis package has numerous variants which allows customizing which\nbindings must be built.\n\n# Installing using `brew`\n\nInstalling `mgis` using `brew` shall be as easy as:\n\n~~~~{.bash}\n$ brew install mgis\n~~~~", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/docs/web/install.md"}], "executable_example": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/docs/web/ipynb/mgis_small_strain.ipynb", "type": "Url", "format": "jupyter_notebook"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/docs/web/ipynb/mgis_small_strain.ipynb"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/docs/web/ipynb/mgis_finite_strain.ipynb", "type": "Url", "format": "jupyter_notebook"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/docs/web/ipynb/mgis_finite_strain.ipynb"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/.github/workflows/check-tbb.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/.github/workflows/check.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "contributors": [{"result": {"value": "The following bindings are under consideration:\n\n- `octave` binding\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Future bindings (contributors are welcomed)", "parent_header": ["MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport", "Bindings"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelfer/MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport/master/README.md"}], "acknowledgement": [{"result": {"value": "This project uses code extracted from the following projects:\n\n- https://github.com/bitwizeshift/string_view-standalone by Matthew\n  Rodusek\n- https://github.com/mpark/variant: by Michael Park\n- https://github.com/progschj/ThreadPool by Jakob Progsch and V\u00e1clav\n  Zeman\n- https://github.com/martinmoene/span-lite by Martin Moene\n- https://bitbucket.org/fenics-apps/fenics-solid-mechanics/ by\n  Kristian B. \u00d8lgaard and Garth N.
