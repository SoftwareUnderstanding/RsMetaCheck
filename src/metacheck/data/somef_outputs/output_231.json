Tensorflow 2.0.0, which comes with it a host of new very exciting features!\n\n## Optimizers\n\nThe latest interface to optimizers in tensorflow are now used, these changes are described.\n\n* `gradient_descent` gains `momentum` and `nesterov` arguments, as described here in [TF docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/SGD)\n* `adagrad` gains [`epsilon` argument](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adagrad)\n* removes `momentum` optimizer, as this has been folded into `gradient_descent` arguments\n* Adds `amsgrad` argument to `adam` optimizer, as described in [TF docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam)\n* Adds `adamax` optimiser, see [TF docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adamax)\n* Adds `l2_shrinkage_regularization_strength` and `beta` arguments to `ftrl`\n  optimiser.\n* adds `nadam` optimiser - see [docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Nadam).\n* In `rms_prop` optimiser, changes `decay` parameter to `rho`, and adds `centered` parameter - see [docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/RMSprop)\n\nThe following optimisers are removed, as they are no longer supported by Tensorflow:\n\n * `powell()`\n * `cg()`\n * `newton_cg()`\n * `l_bfgs_b()`\n * `tnc()`\n * `cobyla()`\n * `slsqp()`\n\n## Installation revamp\n\nThis release provides a few improvements to installation in greta. It should now provide more information about installation progress, and be more robust. The intention is, it should _just work_, and if it doesn't, it should fail gracefully with some useful advice on problem solving.\n\n* Added option to restart R + run `library(greta)` after installation (#523).\n* Added installation deps object, `greta_deps_sepc()` to help simplify specifying package versions (#664).\n* Removed `method` and `conda` arguments from `install_greta_deps()` as they \n  were not used.\n* Removed `manual` argument in `install_greta_deps()`.\n* Added default 5 minute timer to installation processes.\n* Added `greta_deps_receipt()` to list the current main python packages installed (#668).\n* Added checking suite to ensure you are using valid versions of TF, TFP, and Python(#666).\n* Added data `greta_deps_tf_tfp` (#666), which contains valid versions combinations of TF, TFP, and Python.\n* Remove `greta_nodes_install/conda_*()` options as #493 makes them defunct.\n* Added option to write to a single logfile with `greta_set_install_logfile()`, and `write_greta_install_log()`, and `open_greta_install_log()` (#493).\n* Added `destroy_greta_deps()` function to remove miniconda and python conda environment.\n* Improved `write_greta_install_log()` and `open_greta_install_log()` to use `tools::R_user_dir()` to always write to a file location. `open_greta_install_log()` will open one found from an environment variable or go to the default location (#703).\n\n## New Print methods\n\n* New print method for `greta_mcmc_list`. This means MCMC output will be shorter and more informative (#644).\n* greta arrays now have a print method that stops them from printing too many rows into the console. Similar to MCMC print method, you can control the print output with the `n` argument: `print(object, n = <elements to print>)` (#644).\n\n## Minor\n\n* `greta_sitrep()` now checks for installations of Python, TF, and TFP.\n* Slice sampler no longer needs precision = \"single\" to work.\n* greta now depends on R 4.1.0, which was released May 2021, over 3 years ago.\n* export `is.greta_array()` and `is.greta_mcmc_list()`.\n* `restart` argument for `install_greta_deps()` and `reinstall_greta_deps()` to automatically restart R (#523).\n\n## Internals\n\n* Internally we are replacing most of the error handling code as separate \n  `check_*` functions.\n* Implemented `cli::cli_abort/warn/inform()` in place of `cli::format_error/warning/message()` + `stop/warning/message(msg, call. = FALSE)` pattern.\n* Uses legacy optimizer internally (Use `tf$keras$optimizers$legacy$METHOD` over `tf$keras$optimizers$METHOD`). No user impact expected.\n* Update photo of Grete Hermann (#598).\n* Use `%||%` internally to replace the pattern: `if (is.null(x)) x <- thing` with `x <- x %||% thing` (#630).\n* Add more explaining variables - replace `if (thing & thing & what == this)` with `if (explanation_of_thing)`.\n* Refactored repeated uses of `vapply` into functions (#377, #658).\n* Add internal data files `.deps_tf` and `.deps_tfp` to track dependencies of TF and TFP. Related to #666.\n\n- Posterior density checks (#720):\n  - Don't run Geweke on CI as it takes 30 minutes to run.\n  - Add thinning to Geweke tests.\n  - Fix broken geweke tests from TF1-->TF2 change.\n  - Increase the number of effective samples for check_samples for lkj distribution\n  - Add more checks to posterior to run on CI/on each test of greta\n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* Fix bug where matrix multiply had dimension error before coercing to greta array. (#464)\n- Fixes for Wishart and LKJ Correlation distributions (#729 #733 #734):\n  - Add bijection density to choleskied distributions.\n  - Note about some issues with LKJ and our normalisation constant for the density.\n  - Removed our custom `forward_log_det_jacobian()` function from `tf_correlation_cholesky_bijector()` (used in `lkj_correlation()`). Previously, it did not work with unknown dimensions, but it now works with them.\n  - Ensure wishart uses sigma_chol in scale_tril\n  - Wishart uses `tf$matmul(chol_draws, chol_draws, adjoint_b = TRUE)` instead of `tf_chol2symm(chol_draws)`.\n  - Test log prob function returns valid numeric numbers.\n  - Addresses issue with log prob returning NaNs--replace `FillTriangular` with `FillScaleTriL` and apply Chaining to first transpose input.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/tarball/v0.5.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/zipball/v0.5.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/releases/tag/v0.5.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/185020860", "release_id": 185020860, "date_created": "2024-11-10T00:42:36Z", "date_published": "2024-11-13T00:23:17Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/145940599", "tag": "v0.4.5", "name": "greta 0.4.5", "author": {"name": "njtierney", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Bug Fixes\n\n- Remove trailing comma bug in glue #618\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/tarball/v0.4.5", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/zipball/v0.4.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/releases/tag/v0.4.5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/145940599", "release_id": 145940599, "date_created": "2024-03-11T05:59:07Z", "date_published": "2024-03-11T23:02:04Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/139600495", "tag": "v0.4.4", "name": "greta 0.4.4", "author": {"name": "njtierney", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Bug fixes\n\n- Some small documentation bugs were fixed, namely the sentinel \"_PACKAGE\" documentation, and various small changes to correctly export S3 methods.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/tarball/v0.4.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/zipball/v0.4.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/releases/tag/v0.4.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/139600495", "release_id": 139600495, "date_created": "2024-02-02T00:13:09Z", "date_published": "2024-02-02T00:59:55Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/76664403", "tag": "v0.4.3", "name": "greta 0.4.3", "author": {"name": "njtierney", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Features\r\n\r\n- Adds `reinstall_greta_deps()`, which helps with starting from a clean slate when installing greta dependencies (#524)\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\n* Issue where `future` and `parallely` packages error when a CPU with only one core is provided (#513, #516).\r\n* Removes any use of `multiprocess` as it is deprecated in the `future` package (#394)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/tarball/v0.4.3", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/zipball/v0.4.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/releases/tag/v0.4.3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/76664403", "release_id": 76664403, "date_created": "2022-09-08T13:37:28Z", "date_published": "2022-09-09T02:36:05Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/62549662", "tag": "v0.4.2", "name": "greta 0.4.2", "author": {"name": "njtierney", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Fixes\r\n\r\n* workaround for M1 issues (#507)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/tarball/v0.4.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/zipball/v0.4.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/releases/tag/v0.4.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/62549662", "release_id": 62549662, "date_created": "2022-03-22T00:13:42Z", "date_published": "2022-03-23T08:38:09Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/greta-dev/greta/releases/61866546", "tag": "v0.4.1", "name": "greta 0.4.1", "author": {"name": "njtierney", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis release presents a variety of improvements over the past 2 years. We are now aiming to have smaller, more regular releases of `greta`. This release showcases new features implemented by Nick Golding on the `calculate` and `simulate` functions. There are also many internal changes on installation, error printing, and testing. This release also sees changing of maintainer, from Nick Golding to Nick Tierney.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nWe have overhauled the installation checking process, and created a new helper function for installation, `install_greta_deps()`.\r\n\r\nWe need the Tensorflow and Tensorflow Probability Python modules to use `greta`.\r\nWhen these aren't installed, this now triggers a new prompt which encourages users\r\nto use a new installation helper, which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#> We have detected that you do not have the expected python packages setup.\r\n#> You can set these up by running this R code in the console:\r\n#> `install_greta_deps()`\r\n#> Then, restart R and run:\r\n#> `library(greta)`\r\n#> (Note: Your R session should not have initialised Tensorflow yet.)\r\n#> For more information, see `?install_greta_deps`\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `install_greta_deps()` will then go through the process of installing the dependencies, and ask the user to restart R and load `greta` to get it working:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#> \u2713 Installation of greta dependencies is complete!\r\n#> \u2022 Restart R, then load greta with: `library(greta)`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `install_greta_deps()` function helps ensure Python dependencies are installed correctly. This saves exact versions of Python (3.7), and the python modules NumPy (1.16.4), Tensorflow (1.14.0), and Tensorflow Probability (0.7.0) into a conda environment, \"greta-env\". \r\n\r\nSo what is a conda environment? It is similar to the R projects, `packrat` and `renv` (although I believe conda environments are a much older idea!). It allows you to use specific versions of Python and Python modules (Python module = R Package) that do not interact with other projects. Essentially, you \"activate\" a specific conda environment, which loads the specified Python version and modules. This means you avoid situations where you might update a python module and then all your other code breaks because breaking changes were introduced in a new version.\r\n\r\nWhy do we need this? Currently `greta` needs specific versions of Tensorflow and Tensorflow Probability, and we know that those specific versions work with a specific version of Python. We wanted to keep things stable for users, so they don't have to go through the (often) painful process of installing dependencies.\r\n\r\nHow does it work? When `greta` is loaded, say with `library(greta)`, it searches for a \"greta-env\" conda environment and loads it. It is not required to use the conda environment, \"greta-env\", so you can install these Python modules yourself.\r\n\r\nOverall this means that users can run the function `install_greta_deps()`, follow the prompts, and have all the python modules they need installed, without contaminating other software that use different python modules.\r\n\r\n### Error printing\r\n\r\nWe have reviewed all of the error messages in greta, and rewritten the printing methods for the error messages to use the `cli` package for prettier, more informative testing. We have also used the `glue` package in place of most uses of `sprintf` or `paste/0`, as the literal string interpolation makes it easier to maintain. For example:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\npaste0(\"Objects is of class: \", class(10))\r\n#> [1] \"Objects is of class: numeric\"\r\nsprintf(\"Objects is of class: %s\", class(10))\r\n#> [1] \"Objects is of class: numeric\"\r\nglue::glue(\"Objects is of class: {class(10)}\")\r\n#> Objects is of class: numeric\r\ncat(cli::format_message(\"Objects is of class: {.cls {class(10)}}\"))\r\n#> Objects is of class: <numeric>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing `cli` also means we get nifty outputs like this from the new `greta_sitrep()` function, which tests if Python and its dependencies are available\r\n\r\n``` r\r\ngreta::greta_sitrep()\r\n#> \u2139 checking if python available\r\n#> \u2713 python (version 3.7) available\r\n#> \r\n#> \u2139 checking if TensorFlow available\r\n#> \u2713 TensorFlow (version 1.14.0) available\r\n#> \r\n#> \u2139 checking if TensorFlow Probability available\r\n#> \u2713 TensorFlow Probability (version 0.7.0) available\r\n#> \r\n#> \u2139 checking if greta conda environment available\r\n#> \u2713 greta conda environment available\r\n#> \r\n#> \u2139 Initialising python and checking dependencies, this may take a moment.\r\n#> \u2713 Initialising python and checking dependencies ... done!\r\n#> \r\n#> \u2139 greta is ready to use!\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nWe have also overhauled the testing interface to use [snapshotting](https://testthat.r-lib.org/reference/index.html#snapshot-testing). This makes it easier to write and test new error messages, and identify issues with existing print methods, errors, and warnings.\r\n\r\n### Looking to the future\r\n\r\nIn a future release we will switch to using TensorFlow 2.6 (or higher), to ensure `greta` works with Apple computers with an M1 chip. We note that we have gone from  \"skipped\" version 0.4.0, however this is because we had a soft release of 0.4.0 on GitHub in December, and wanted to signify that this package has changed since that time.\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\nA special thanks to everyone who helped with this release: [Nick Golding](https://github.com/goldingn), [Jacob Wujciak-Jens](https://github.com/assignUser), and [Ma\u00eblle Salmon](https://github.com/maelle).\r\n\r\n## Fixes:\r\n\r\n* Python is now initialised when a `greta_array` is created (#468).\r\n\r\n* head and tail S3 methods for `greta_array` are now consistent with head and tail methods for R versions 3 and 4 ([#384](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/issues/384)).\r\n\r\n* `greta_mcmc_list` objects (returned by `mcmc()`) are now no longer modified by operations (like `coda::gelman.diag()`). \r\n\r\n* joint distributions of uniform variables now have the correct constraints when sampling (#377).\r\n\r\n* array-scalar dispatch with 3D arrays is now less buggy (#298).\r\n\r\n* `greta` now provides R versions of all of R's primitive functions (I think), to prevent them from silently not executing (#317).\r\n\r\n* Uses `Sys.unsetenv(\"RETICULATE_PYTHON\")` in `.onload` on package startup, \r\n  to prevent an issue introduced with the \"ghost orchid\" version of RStudio where they do not find the current version of RStudio. See [#444](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/issues/444) for more details.\r\n  \r\n* Internal change to code to ensure `future` continues to support parallelisation of chains. See [#447](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/issues/447) for more details.\r\n\r\n* `greta` now depends on `future` version 1.22.1, `tensorflow` (the R package) 2.7.0, and `parallelly` 1.29.0. This should see no changes on the user side.\r\n\r\n## API changes:\r\n\r\n* Now depends on R >= 3.1.0 ([#386](https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/issues/386))\r\n\r\n* `chol2inv.greta_array()` now warns user about LINPACK argument being ignored, and also reminds user it has been deprecated since R 3.1\r\n\r\n* `calculate()` now accepts multiple greta arrays for which to calculate values, via the `...` argument. As a consequence any other arguments must now be named.\r\n\r\n* A number of optimiser methods are now deprecated, since they will be unavailable when greta moves to using TensorFlow v2.0: `powell()`, `cg()`, `newton_cg()`, `l_bfgs_b()`, `tnc()`, `cobyla()`, and `slsqp()`.\r\n\r\n* `dirichlet()` now returns a variable (rather than an operation) greta array, and the graphs created by `lkj_correlation()` and `wishart()` are now simpler as cholesky-shaped variables are now available internally.\r\n\r\n* Adds the `reinstall_greta_env()`, `reinstall_miniconda()`, `remove_greta_env()`, and  `remove_miniconda()` helper functions for helping installation get to \"clean slate\" (#443).\r\n\r\n* `greta` currently doesn't work on Apple Silicon (M1 Macs) as they need to use TF 2.0, which is currently being implemented. `greta` now throws an error if M1 macs are detected and directs users to https://github.com/greta-dev/greta/issues/458 (#487)\r\n\r\n## Features:\r\n\r\n* New `install_greta_deps()` - provides installation of python dependencies (#417). This saves exact versions of Python (3.7), and the python modules NumPy (1.16.4), Tensorflow (1.14.0), and Tensorflow Probability (0.7.0) into a conda environment, \"greta-env\". When initialising Python, greta now searches for this conda environment first, which presents a great advantage as it isolates these exact versions of these modules from other Python installations. It is not required to use the conda environment, \"greta-env\". Overall this means that users can run the function `install_greta_deps()`, follow the prompts, and have all the python modules they need installed, without contaminating other  software that use different python modules.\r\n\r\n* `calculate()` now enables simulation of greta array values from their priors, optionally conditioned on fixed values or posterior samples. This enables prior and posterior predictive checking of models, and simulation of data.\r\n\r\n* A `simulate()` method for greta models is now also provided, to simulate the values of all greta arrays in a model from their priors. \r\n\r\n* `variable()` now accepts arrays for `upper` and `lower`, enabling users to define variables with different constraints.\r\n\r\n* There are three new variable constructor functions: `cholesky_variable()`, `simplex_variable()`, and `ordered_variable()`, for variables with these constraints but no probability distribution.\r\n\r\n* New `chol2symm()` is the inverse of `chol()`.\r\n\r\n* `mcmc()`, `stashed_samples()`, and `calculate()` now return objects of class `greta_mcmc_list` which inherit from `coda`'s `mcmc.list` class, but enable custom greta methods for manipulating mcmc outputs, including a `window()` function.\r\n\r\n* `mcmc()` and `calculate()` now have a `trace_batch_size` argument enabling users to trade-off computation speed versus memory requirements when calculating posterior samples for target greta arrays (#236).\r\n\r\n* Many message, warning, and error prompts have been replaced internally with the {cli} R package for nicer printing. This is a minor change that should result in a more pleasant user experience (#423 #425).\r\n\r\n* Internally, where sensible, `greta` now uses the `glue` package to create messages/ouputs (#378).\r\n\r\n* New FAQ page and updated installation instructions for installing Python dependencies (#424)\r\n\r\n* New `greta_sitrep()` function to generate a situation report of the software\r\n  that is available for use, and also initialising python so `greta` is ready to\r\n  use.

TF and TFP are python packages, and so are required to be installed. This is different to how normal dependencies work with R packages, where the dependencies are automagically built and managed by CRAN. \n\nUnfortunately, there isn't an automatic, reliable way to ensure that these are provided along when you install greta, so we need to take an additional step to install them. We have tried very hard to make the process as easy as possible by providing a helper function, `install_greta_deps()`.\n\n# How to install python dependencies using `install_greta_deps()`\n\nWe recommend running:\n\n```{r}\n#| eval: FALSE\ninstall_greta_deps()\n```\n\nAnd then following any prompts to install dependencies. You will then need to restart R and load `library(greta)` to start using greta.\n\n# How `install_greta_deps()` works\n\nThe `install_greta_deps()` function installs the Python dependencies TF and TFP. \nBy default it installs versions TF 2.15.0, and TFP version 0.23.0. It places these inside a conda environment, \"greta-env-tf2\". For the default settings, this is python 3.10. Using a conda environment isolates these exact python modules from other python installations, so only `greta` will see them. \n\nWe do this as it helps avoids installation issues, where previously you might update TF on your computer and overwrite the current version needed by `greta`. Using this \"greta-env-tf2\" conda environment means installing other python packages should not be impact the Python packages needed by `greta`. It is part of the recommended way to [manage python dependencies in an R package](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_dependencies.html) as recommended by the team at Posit.\n\n## Using different versions of TF, TFP, and Python\n\nThe `install_greta_deps()` function takes three arguments:\n\n1. `deps`: Specify dependencies with `greta_deps_spec()`\n2. `timeout`: time in minutes to wait in installation before failing/exiting\n3. `restart`: whether to restart R (\"force\" - restart R, \"no\", will not restart, \"ask\" (default) - ask the user)\n\nYou specify the version of TF TFP, or python that you want to use with `greta_deps_spec()`, which has arguments:\n\n- `tf_version`\n- `tfp_version`\n- `python_version`\n\nIf you specify versions of TF/TFP/Python that are not compatible with each other, it will error before starting installation. We determined the appropriate versions of Python, TF, and TFP from https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#tested_build_configurations and https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows#tested_build_configurations, and by inspecting TFP release notes. We put this information together into a dataset, `greta_deps_tf_tfp`. You can inspect this with `View(greta_deps_tf_tfp)`.\n\nIf you provide an invalid installation versions, it will error and suggest some alternative installation versions.\n\n## How we install dependencies\n\nFor users who want to know more about the installation process of dependencies in greta.\n\nWe create a separate R instance using [`callr`](https://callr.r-lib.org/index.html) to install python dependencies using `reticulate` to talk to Python, and the R package `tensorflow`, for installing the tensorflow python module. We use `callr` so that we can ensure the installation of python dependencies happens in a clean R session that doesn't have python or reticulate already loaded. It also means that we can hide the large amounts of text output to the console that happens when installation is running - these are written a logfile during installation that you can read with `open_greta_install_log()`.\n\nIf miniconda isn't installed, we install miniconda. You can think of miniconda as a lightweight version of python with minimal dependencies.\n\nIf \"greta-tf2-env\" isn't found, then we create a new conda environment named \"greta-tf2-env\", for a version of python that works with the specified versions of TF and TFP.\n\nThen we install the TF and TFP python modules, using the versions specified in `greta_deps_spec()`.\n\nAfter installation, we ask users if they want to restart R. This only happens in interactive sessions, and only if the user is in RStudio. This is to avoid potential issues where this script might be used in batch scripts online.\n\n## Troubleshooting installation\n\nInstallation doesn't always go to plan. Here are some approaches to getting your dependencies working. \n\n- Check you have restarted R after installing dependencies\n  - After you have installed dependencies with `install_greta_deps()`, you will be prompted to restart R. To use greta you must restart R after installing dependencies as this allows greta to connect to the installed python dependencies.\n\n- Use `greta_sitrep()` to check dependencies.\n  - `greta_sitrep()` will provide information about your installed version of Python, TF, TFP, and whether a conda environment is used. This can be helpful to troubleshoot some installation issues.\n\n- Check the installation logfile\n  - During installation we write a logfile, which records all of the steps taken during installation. This can sometimes provide useful clues as to what might have gone awry during installation. You can open the logfile with `open_greta_install_log()`, which opens the logfile in a browser window, and scroll through it to try and find errors or things that went wrong during installation. We recommend viewing this with `open_greta_install_log()` and then searching with Ctrl/Cmd+F for things like \"error/Error/ERROR/warn/etc\" to find problems. There might not be a clear solution to the problem, but the logfile might provide clues to the problem that you can share on a forum or issue on the greta github.\n\n- Reinstall greta dependencies with `reinstall_greta_deps()`\n  - Sometimes we just need to \"turn it off and on again\". Use `reinstall_greta_deps()` to remove miniconda, and the greta conda environment, and install them again.\n\n- Manually remove python installation\n  - You can manually remove python installation by doing:\n    - `remove_greta_env()`\n    - `remove_miniconda()`\n    - or `destroy_greta_deps()`, which does both of these steps.\n  - Then install the dependences with: `install_greta_deps()`\n    - Note that this is functionally what `reinstall_greta_deps()` does, but sometimes it can be useful to separate them out into separate steps.\n    \n- Check internet access\n  - Installing these dependencies requires an internet connection, and sometimes the internet service provider (perhaps IT?) blocks websites like conda from downloading. In the past we have encountered this issue and have found that it can be avoided by doing re-installation with `reinstall_greta_deps()`.\n\nIf the previous installation helper did not work, you can try the following:\n\n```{r install_tensorflow, eval = FALSE}\nreticulate::install_miniconda()\nreticulate::conda_create(\n        envname = \"greta-env-tf2\",\n        python_version = \"3.10\"\n      )\nreticulate::conda_install(\n        envname = \"greta-env-tf2\",\n        packages = c(\n          \"tensorflow-probability==0.23.0\",\n          \"tensorflow==2.15.0\"\n        )\n      )\n```\n\nWhich will install the python modules into a conda environment named \"greta-env-tf2\".\n\nYou can also not install these not into a special conda environment like so:\n\n```{r install-deps-plain, eval = FALSE}\nreticulate::install_miniconda()\nreticulate::conda_install(\n        packages = c(\n          \"tensorflow-probability==0.23.0\",\n          \"tensorflow==2.15.0\"\n        )\n      )\n```\n\n<!-- You can also use `install_tensorflow()` to install different versions of TensorFlow, including versions with GPU acceleration. If you're having trouble with this step, [this guide](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/installation/) may help. -->\n\n<hr>\n\n<!-- You can also use `install_tensorflow()` to install different versions of TensorFlow, including versions with GPU acceleration.
