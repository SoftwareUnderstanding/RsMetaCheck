Before your first merge, you will need to be added to the [CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/biogo/biogo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS) and [AUTHORS](https://github.com/biogo/biogo/blob/master/AUTHORS) file.\nOpen a pull request adding yourself to them.\nAll b\u00edogo code follows the BSD license in the [license document](https://github.com/biogo/biogo/blob/master/LICENSE).\nWe prefer that code contributions do not come with additional licensing.\nFor exceptions, added code must also follow a BSD license.\n\n## Code Contribution\n\nIf it is possible to split a large pull request into two or more smaller pull requests, please try to do so.\nPull requests should include tests for any new code before merging.\nIt is ok to start a pull request on partially implemented code to get feedback, and see if your approach to a problem is sound.\nYou don't need to have tests, or even have code that compiles to open a pull request, although both will be needed before merge.\nWhen tests use magic numbers, please include a comment explaining the source of the number.\nBenchmarks are optional for new features, but if you are submitting a pull request justified by performance improvement, you will need benchmarks to measure the impact of your change, and the pull request should include a report from [benchcmp](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/benchcmp) or, preferably, [benchstat](https://github.com/rsc/benchstat).\n\n## Code Review\n\nIf you are a contributor, please be welcoming to new contributors.  [Here](http://sarah.thesharps.us/2014/09/01/the-gentle-art-of-patch-review/) is a good guide.\n\nThere are several terms code reviews may use that you should become familiar with.\n\n  * ` LGTM ` \u2014 looks good to me\n  * ` SGTM ` \u2014 sounds good to me\n  * ` s/foo/bar/ ` \u2014 please replace ` foo ` with ` bar `; this is [sed syntax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed#Usage)\n  * ` s/foo/bar/g ` \u2014 please replace ` foo ` with ` bar ` throughout your entire change\n\nWe follow the convention of requiring at least 1 reviewer to say LGTM before a merge.\nWhen code is tricky or controversial, submitters and reviewers can request additional review from others and more LGTMs before merge.\nYou can ask for more review by saying PTAL in a comment in a pull request.\nYou can follow a PTAL with one or more @someone to get the attention of particular people.\nIf you don't know who to ask, and aren't getting enough review after saying PTAL, then PTAL @biogo/\ncontributors will get more attention.\nAlso note that you do not have to be the pull request submitter to request additional review.\n\n## What Can I Do to Help?\n\nIf you are looking for some way to help the b\u00edogo project, there are good places to start, depending on what you are comfortable with.\nYou can [search](https://github.com/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Abiogo) for open issues in need of resolution.\nYou can improve documentation, or improve examples.\nYou can add and improve tests.\nYou can improve performance, either by improving accuracy, speed, or both.\nYou can suggest and implement new features that you think belong in b\u00edogo.\n\n## Style\n\nWe use [Go style](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biogo/biogo/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "If you find any bugs, feel free to file an issue on the github issue tracker.\nPull requests are welcome, though if they involve changes to API or addition of features, please first open a discussion at the biogo-dev Google Group.\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biogo-dev\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contributing"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biogo/biogo/master/README.md"}], "contributors": [{"result": {"value": "# This is the official list of people who can contribute\n# (and typically have contributed) code to the b\u00edogo repository.\n#\n# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file\n# lists people.
