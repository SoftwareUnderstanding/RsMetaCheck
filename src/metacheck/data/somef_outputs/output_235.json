Great! `aorsf` is in an initially stable state of development, with a great deal of active subsequent development envisioned. Below is an outline of how to propose a change to `aorsf`. \n\nFor more detailed info about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the\n[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib). \n\n## Fixing typos\n\nYou can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. \nThis generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. \nYou can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n## Bigger changes\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s needed. \nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"ropensci/aorsf\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the aorsf project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
