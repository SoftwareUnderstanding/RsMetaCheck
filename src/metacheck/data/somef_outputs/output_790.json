To automate the\nretrieval process of this information on a meta-genomic scale, the `biomartr` package provides interface functions for genomic sequence retrieval and functional annotation retrieval. The major aim of `biomartr` is to facilitate computational reproducibility and large-scale handling of genomic data for (meta-)genomic analyses.\nIn addition, `biomartr` aims to address the `genome version crisis`. With `biomartr` users can now control and be informed \nabout the genome versions they retrieve automatically. Many large scale genomics studies lack this information\nand thus, reproducibility and data interpretation become nearly impossible when documentation of genome version information\ngets neglected.\n\nIn detail, `biomartr` automates genome, proteome, CDS, RNA, Repeats, GFF/GTF (annotation), genome assembly quality, and metagenome project data retrieval from the major biological databases such as\n\n- [NCBI RefSeq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/)\n- [NCBI Genbank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)\n- [ENSEMBL](https://www.ensembl.org/index.html)\n- [ENSEMBLGENOMES](http://ensemblgenomes.org) (as of April 2019 - `ENSEMBL` and `ENSEMBLGENOMES` were joined - see [details here](https://www.ensembl.info/2019/03/08/joint-rest-server-for-ensembl-and-ensembl-genomes-in-ensembl-96/))\n- [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org)\n\nFurthermore, an interface to the `Ensembl Biomart` database allows users to retrieve functional annotation for genomic loci using a novel and organism centric search strategy. In addition, users can [download entire databases](https://docs.ropensci.org/biomartr/articles/Database_Retrieval.html) such as \n\n- `NCBI RefSeq` \n- `NCBI nr` \n- `NCBI nt`\n- `NCBI Genbank`\n- `ENSEMBL` \n\nwith only one command.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Short package description:", "parent_header": ["biomartr", "Genomic Data Retrieval with R"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/blob/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "This package is born out of my own frustration to automate the genomic data retrieval process to create computationally reproducible scripts for large-scale genomics studies.

Furthermore, `biomartr` allows you to search for particular topics when searching for attributes and filters. I am aware that the similar naming of the packages is unfortunate, but it arose due to historical reasons (please find a detailed explanation here: https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/blob/master/FAQs.md and here [#11](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/issues/11)). \nI also dedicated [an entire vignette to compare](https://docs.ropensci.org/biomartr/articles/Functional_Annotation.html) the `BiomaRt` and `biomartr` package functionality in the context of `Functional Annotation` (where their functionality overlaps which comprises about only 20% of the overall functionality of the biomartr package).\n \n", "original_header": "Similar Work"}, "confidence": 0.9072022853948307, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/blob/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/blob/master/CONDUCT.md).

Find more details [here](https://github.com/lawremi/rtracklayer/issues/15)\r\n\r\n- new function `getCollectionSet()` allows users to retrieve a Collection: Genome, Proteome, CDS, RNA, GFF, Repeat Masker, AssemblyStats of multiple species\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# define scientific names of species for which\r\n# collections shall be retrieved\r\norganism_list <- c(\"Arabidopsis thaliana\", \r\n                   \"Arabidopsis lyrata\", \r\n                   \"Capsella rubella\")\r\n# download the collection of Arabidopsis thaliana from refseq\r\n# and store the corresponding genome file in '_ncbi_downloads/collection'\r\n getCollectionSet( db       = \"refseq\", \r\n             organism = organism_list, \r\n             path = \"set_collections\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### New Features \r\n\r\n- the `getGFF()` function receives a new argument `remove_annotation_outliers` to enable users to remove corrupt lines from a GFF file\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nAth_path <- biomartr::getGFF(organism = \"Arabidopsis thaliana\", remove_annotation_outliers = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- the `getGFFSet()` function receives a new argument `remove_annotation_outliers` to enable users to remove corrupt lines from a GFF file\r\n\r\n- the `getGTF()` function receives a new argument `remove_annotation_outliers` to enable users to remove corrupt lines from a GTF file\r\n\r\n- adding a new message system to `biomartr::organismBM()`, `biomartr::organismAttributes()`, and `biomartr::organismFilters()` so that large API queries don't seem so unresponsive\r\n\r\n- `getCollection()` receives new arguments `release`, `remove_annotation_outliers`, and `gunzip` that will now be passed on to downstream retrieval functions\r\n\r\n- the `getGTF()`, `getGenome()` and `getGenomeSet()` functions receives a new argument `assembly_type = \"toplevel\"` to enable users to choose between toplevel and primary assembly when using ensembl database. Setting `assembly_type = \"primary_assembly\"` will save a lot a space on hard drives for people using large ensembl genomes.\r\n\r\n- all `get*()` functions with `release` argument now check if the ENSEMBL release is >45 (Many thanks to @Roleren #31 #61) \r\n\r\n- in all `get*()` functions, the `readr::write_tsv(path = )` was exchanged to `readr::write_tsv(file = )`, since the `readr` package version > 1.4.0 is depreciating the `path` argument. \r\n\r\n- `tbl_df()` was deprecated in dplyr 1.0.0.\r\nPlease use `tibble::as_tibble()` instead. -> adjusted `organismBM()` accordingly\r\n\r\n- `custom_download()`, `getGENOMEREPORT()`, and other download functions now have specified `withr::local_options(timeout = max(30000000, getOption(\"timeout\")))` which extends the default 60sec timeout to 30000000sec\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixing bug where genome availability check in `getCollection()` was only performed in `NCBI RefSeq` and not in other databases due to a constant used in `is.genome.available()` rather than a variable (Many thanks to Takahiro Yamada for catching the bug) #53\r\n\r\n- fixing an issue that caused the `read_cds()` function to fail in `data.table` mode (Many thanks to Clement Kent) #57\r\n\r\n- fixing an `SSL` bug that was found on `Ubuntu 20.04` systems #66 (Many thanks to H\u00e5kon Tjeldnes)\r\n\r\n- fixing global variable issue that caused `clean.retrieval()` to fail when no documentation file was in a `meta.retrieval()` folder\r\n\r\n- The NCBI recently started adding `NA` values as FTP file paths in their `species summary files` for species without reference genomes. As a result `meta.retrieval()` stopped working, because no FTP paths were found for some species. This issue was now fixed by adding the filter rule `!is.na(ftp_path)` into all `get*()` functions (Many thanks for making me aware of this issue Ashok Kumar Sharma #34 and Dominik Merges #72) \r\n\r\n- Fixing an issue in `custom_download()` where the `method` argument was causing issues when downloading from `https` directed `ftp` sites (Many thanks to @cmatKhan) #76 \r\n\r\n- Fixing issue when trying to combine multiple summary-stats files where NA's were present in the list item that was passed along for combination in `meta.retrieval()` #73 (Many thanks to Dominik Merges)\r\n\r\n- Fixing a bug in `download.database.all()` where the lack of removing listed file `*-metadata.json` caused corruption of the download process (Many thanks to Jaruwatana Lotharukpong)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/tarball/v1.0.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/zipball/v1.0.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v1.0.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/releases/60150093", "release_id": 60150093, "date_created": "2022-02-22T15:24:03Z", "date_published": "2022-02-22T16:38:39Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/releases/22180515", "tag": "v0.9.1", "name": "Genomic Data Retrieval", "author": {"name": "HajkD", "type": "User"}, "description": " Minor updates to comply with CRAN policy.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/tarball/v0.9.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/zipball/v0.9.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/biomartr/releases/tag/v0.9.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/releases/22180515", "release_id": 22180515, "date_created": "2019-12-10T13:30:22Z", "date_published": "2019-12-12T14:40:57Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/releases/17450495", "tag": "v0.9.0", "name": "Genomic Data Retrieval", "author": {"name": "HajkD", "type": "User"}, "description": "__Please be aware that as of April 2019, ENSEMBLGENOMES\r\nwas retired ([see details here](http://www.ensembl.info/2019/03/08/joint-rest-server-for-ensembl-and-ensembl-genomes-in-ensembl-96/)). Hence, all `biomartr` functions were updated\r\nand won't support data retrieval from `ENSEMBLGENOMES` servers anymore.__\r\n\r\n### New Functions\r\n\r\n- New function `clean.retrieval()` enables formatting and automatic unzipping of meta.retrieval output (find out more here: https://ropensci.github.io/biomartr/articles/MetaGenome_Retrieval.html#un-zipping-downloaded-files)\r\n- New function `getGenomeSet()` allows users to easily retrieve genomes of multiple specified species. \r\nIn addition, the genome summary statistics for all retrieved species will be stored as well to provide\r\nusers with insights regarding the genome assembly quality of each species. This file can be used as Supplementary Information file\r\nin publications to facilitate reproducible research.\r\n- New function `getProteomeSet()` allows users to easily retrieve proteomes of multiple specified species\r\n- New function `getCDSSet()` allows users to easily retrieve coding sequences of multiple specified species\r\n- New function `getGFFSet()` allows users to easily retrieve GFF annotation files of multiple specified species\r\n- New function `getRNASet()` allows users to easily retrieve RNA sequences of multiple specified species\r\n- New function `summary_genome()` allows users to retrieve summary statistics for a genome assembly file to assess \r\nthe influence of genome assembly qualities when performing comparative genomics tasks\r\n- New function `summary_cds()` allows users to retrieve summary statistics for a coding sequence (CDS) file.\r\nWe noticed, that many CDS files stored in NCBI or ENSEMBL databases contain sequences that aren't divisible by 3 (division into codons).\r\nThis makes it difficult to divide CDS into codons for e.g. codon alignments or translation into protein sequences. In\r\naddition, some CDS files contain a significant amount of sequences that do not start with AUG (start codon).\r\nThis function enables users to quantify how many of these sequences exist in a downloaded CDS file to process\r\nthese files according to the analyses at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n### New Features of Existing Functions \r\n\r\n- the default value of argument `reference` in `meta.retrieval()` changed from `reference = TRUE` to `reference = FALSE`.\r\nThis way all genomes (reference AND non-reference) genomes will be downloaded by default. This is what users seem to prefer.\r\n- `getCollection()` now also retrieves `GTF` files when `db = 'ensembl'`\r\n- `getAssemblyStats()` now also performs md5 checksum test\r\n- all md5 checksum tests now retrieve the new md5checkfile format from NCBI RefSeq and Genbank\r\n- `getGTF()`: users can now specify the NCBI Taxonomy ID or Accession ID in addition to the scientific name in argument 'organism' to retrieve genome assemblies \r\n- `getGFF()`: users can now specify the NCBI Taxonomy ID or Accession ID for ENSEMBL in addition to the scientific name in argument 'organism' to retrieve genome assemblies \r\n- `getMarts()` will now throw an error when BioMart servers cannot be reached (#36)\r\n- `getGenome()` now also stores the genome summary statistics (see `?summary_genome()`) for the retrieved species in the `documentation` folder to provide\r\nusers with insights regarding the genome assembly quality\r\n- In all get*() functions the default for argument `reference` is now set from `reference = TRUE` to `reference = FALSE` (= new default)\r\n- all `get*()` functions now received a new argument `release` which allows users to retrieve\r\nspecific release versions of genomes, proteomes, etc from `ENSEMBL` and `ENSEMBLGENOMES`\r\n- all `get*()` functions received two new arguments `clean_retrieval` and  `gunzip` which\r\nallows users to upzip the downloaded files directly in the `get*()` function call and rename\r\nthe file for more convenient downstream analyses\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/biomartr/tarball/v0.9.0", "zipball_url":
