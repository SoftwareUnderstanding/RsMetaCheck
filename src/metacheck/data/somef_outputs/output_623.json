Instead of taking the taxon names from the `bold_identify()` output, and use `bold_tax_name()` to get the taxonomic ID to then pass it to `bold_tax_id()` to get the parent names, we take the process ids from the `bold_identify()` output and then pass them to `bold_specimens()`. This has the advantages of being faster and, more importantly, making sure the correct taxonomy is returned. The function has less arguments since the filtering of the result isn't necessary anymore. Since the result now has only one line per row of input, the output is always in 'wide' format (like when using `bold_identify_parents()` with `wide=TRUE`). There is one new argument `taxOnly` which is `TRUE` by default and return only the taxonomic data. However, since `bold_specimens()` also returns other data (habitat, country, image_url, etc), setting this argument to `FALSE` will also join that data to the input.\r\n\r\n* New function `bold_tax_id2()` which will eventually replace `bold_tax_id()`. The main changes are in the format of the output. For the `dataTypes`  'basic', 'stats', 'images' and 'thirdparty', the output doesn't change. For the `dataTypes` 'sequencinglabs', 'geo' and 'depository', instead of having one (sometimes very) wide data.frame, the result is now in 'long' format, with the columns 'input', 'taxid', 'sequencinglabs|country|depository' and 'count'. For the `dataTypes` 'all' or when selecting more than one dataTypes, the output is a list for each data types containing their respective data.frame. When setting includeTree to `TRUE`, the parents' data is rbinded to their respective data.frame. The function also check that all arguments are the correct type and that the `dataTypes` chosen are valid.\r\n\r\n* The now deprecated `bold_tax_id()` has the same argument checks as `bold_tax_id2()` but will throw warnings instead of errors to not affect existing workflows. Also, if a chosen `dataTypes` is invalid, it gets removed to not make unnecessary requests.\r\n\r\n* Similarly, the now deprecated `bold_identify_parents()` has new argument checks and will throw warnings to not affect existing workflows.\r\n\r\n* For `bold_tax_id2()` and `bold_tax_name()`, when querying multiple taxa, if one fails, the loop won't break and will instead throw the API error as a warning. The output object will also have 2 new attributes \"errors\" and \"params\" that will let you see what errors occurred for with request and what parameters were use for the request.\r\nTo make it easy to retrieve these attributes, 3 new functions have been created:\r\n  * `bold_get_attr()` will return a list of the two attributes\r\n  * `bold_get_errors()` will return a list of the errors\r\n  * `bold_get_params()` will return a list of parameters used\r\n\r\n\r\n* `bold_specimens()` and `bold_seqspec()` have a new parameter `cleanData` which, when set to `TRUE`, replaces empty strings (\"\") by NAs and strings containing only duplicated values by their unique value (ex : \"COI-5P|COI-5P|COI-5P\" becomes \"COI-5P\").\r\n\r\n* New function `bold_read_trace()` to replace `read_trace()`. Can read one or multiple trace files from a `boldtrace` object or provided file path(s).\r\n\r\n* New function `b_sepFasta()` to use after a call to `bold_seqspec()` where `sepFasta` wasn't set to `TRUE`.\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* made tests for the new functions\r\n* made tests for the `bold_trace()` function\r\n* added test to existing functions to improved test coverage\r\n* added/completed argument checks for every functions\r\n* `bold_specimens()` and `bold_seqspec()` can now also return partial output like `bold_seq()`\r\n* using `data.table` when possible, removed `dplyr` and `reshape` dependencies\r\n* using `stringi` instead of `stringr` which removed `stringr`'s other dependencies\r\n* added more details to the documentation of some functions\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n* changed how http responses are read so they throw warnings and return NAs instead of errors. This prevents a long request to stop and fail, loosing the already fetched data. (#74)\r\n* added a note in the documentation of `bold_seq()`, `bold_seqspec()` and `bold_specimen()` that if the `taxon` doesn't have public records, if using another parameter will return all data for that parameter. Users can verify the availability of public records with `bold_stats()`. A note was also added in `bold_tax_name()` that the column 'specimenrecords' relate to the records in the taxonomy browser and not in the public data portal. (#76)\r\n* fixed output of bold_seq() (#79)\r\n* changed the function used to encode to UTF-8 (#81, #86)\r\n* contacted bold so they would fix their typo in 'depository' which prevented fetching related data with `bold_tax_id()` (#83). Added a line in the function to change 'depositories' to 'depository' in case people had been using that.\r\n* added a check for 'name' in `bold_tax_name()` to double escape single quotes. Otherwise it doesn't return the data (#84, #85). Since it's related to the API, this means that the data that comes back also contains errors. So I added a function to repair the names of 'taxon', 'taxonrep' and 'parentname' in the returned object. The function is also used in `pipe_params()` (which is used by `bold_seq()`, `bold_seqspec()` and `bold_specimen()`) to repair the `taxon` parameter in case users use results from previous versions.\r\n* changed the way the response of `bold_seqspec()` is read (#87, #88) thanks @cjfields\r\n* added a note in `bold_stats()` documentation to specify that the record counts include all gene markers (#90).", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v1.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v1.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v1.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/121313007", "release_id": 121313007, "date_created": "2023-09-08T19:49:35Z", "date_published": "2023-09-15T14:36:35Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/42739449", "tag": "v1.2.0", "name": "bold v1.2.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n\n* vignettes fix (#77)\n\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v1.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v1.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/42739449", "release_id": 42739449, "date_created": "2021-05-11T00:41:06Z", "date_published": "2021-05-11T00:41:10Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/27653379", "tag": "v1.1.0", "name": "bold v1.1.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n\n* fix a failing test (#73)\n\n\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v1.1.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v1.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v1.1.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/27653379", "release_id": 27653379, "date_created": "2020-06-17T18:13:29Z", "date_published": "2020-06-17T18:13:33Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/26095664", "tag": "v1.0.0", "name": "bold v1.0.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n\n* change base url for all requests to https from http (#70)\n* fixed a warning arising from use of `bold_seqspec()` -

If `TRUE`\n  you get data.frames of the same dimensions with parent rank name and ID\n  as new columns (for each name going up the hierarchy) - while if `FALSE`\n  you get a long data.frame. thanks @dougwyu for inspiring this (#36)\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- replace `xml2::xml_find_one` with `xml2::xml_find_first` (#33)\n- Fix description of `db` options in `bold_identify` man file -\n  COX1 and COX1_SPECIES were switched (#37) thanks for pointing that out\n  @dougwyu\n\n### BUG FIXES\n- Fix to `bold_tax_id` for when some elements returned from the BOLD\n  API were empty/`NULL` (#32) thanks @fmichonneau !!\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v0.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v0.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/5091922", "release_id": 5091922, "date_created": "2017-01-06T20:47:29Z", "date_published": "2017-01-06T21:10:14Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/2902738", "tag": "v0.3.5", "name": "bold v0.3.5", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- Added more tests to the test suite (#28)\n\n### BUG FIXES\n- Fixed a bug in an internal data parser (#27)\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v0.3.5", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v0.3.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.3.5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/2902738", "release_id": 2902738, "date_created": "2016-03-28T22:39:50Z", "date_published": "2016-03-28T22:45:09Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/2876598", "tag": "v0.3.4", "name": "bold v0.3.4", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### NEW FEATURES\n- Added a code of conduct\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- Switched to `xml2` from `XML` as the XML parser for this package (#26)\n- Fixes to `bold_trace()` to create dir and tar file when it doesn't \n  already exist\n\n### BUG FIXES\n- Fixed odd problem where sometimes resulting data from HTTP request \n  was garbled on `content(x, \"text\")`, so now using `rawToChar(content(x))`,\n  which works (#24)\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v0.3.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v0.3.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.3.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/2876598", "release_id": 2876598, "date_created": "2016-03-23T20:52:42Z", "date_published": "2016-03-23T21:46:12Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/1818469", "tag": "v0.3.0", "name": "bold 0.3.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- Explicitly import non-base R functions (#22)\n- Better package level manual file\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/tarball/v0.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/zipball/v0.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/bold/releases/tag/v0.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/1818469", "release_id": 1818469, "date_created": "2015-09-15T20:57:36Z", "date_published": "2015-09-15T21:38:10Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/bold/releases/1190354", "tag": "v0.2.6", "name": "bold v0.2.6", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `sangerseqR` package now in Suggests for reading trace files, and is only used in `bold_trace()`\n  function. \n- General code tidying, reduction of code duplication.\n- `bold_trace()` gains two new parameters: `overwrite` to choose whether to overwrite an existing\n  file of the same name or not, `progress` to show a progress bar for downloading or not.\n- `bold_trace()` gains a print method to show a tidy summary of the trace file downloaded.\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- Fixed similar bugs in `bold_tax_name()` (#17) and `bold_tax_id()` (#18) in which species that were missing from the BOLD database returned empty arrays but 200 status codes.
