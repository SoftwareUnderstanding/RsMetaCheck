check our [**Contribution Guidelines**](https://everse.software/RSQKit/contribution_guidelines) for details.**\n\nThe [RSQKit website](https://everse.software/RSQKit/) is automatically built and deployed whenever changes are merged into the main branch of this repository.\nFor every pull request, a preview version of the resulting site will be generated by [Netlify](https://everse-rsqkit-testing.netlify.app/).\nTherefore, it is generally not necessary to install the RSQKit locally and contributions can be made via GitHub interface too.\n\nNevertheless, if you do wish to run the RSQKit website locally for development and testing purposes, please follow the instructions below.\n\nWe provide instructions for installing RSQKit and all the software necessary to run it directly on you machine or within a Docker container.\n\n## Installing RSQKit directly on your machine\n\n**Prerequisites:** `ruby`, `bundler` and `jekyll`.\n\nThe RSQKit uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate the website based on the files and information located in this repository.\nJekyll is a Ruby gem which can be installed on most systems.\n\nTo install Ruby, follow the [Ruby installation instructions](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for your operating system.\nYou will also need [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) (a gem to manage other Ruby gems on your system) - but it is usually preinstalled with modern distributions of Ruby.\n\nTo install Jekyll, follow the [official installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).\n\nAfter successfully installing `ruby`, `bundler` and `jekyll`, clone the RSQKit repository on your machine (e.g. using SSH):\n\n``` bash\ngit clone git@github.com:EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit.git\n```\n\nNext, you will need to install the dependencies of the RSQKit itself:\n\n``` bash\ncd RSQKit\nbundle install\n```\n\nYou can build and run the RSQKit locally using the following command from within the RSQKit folder:\n\n``` bash\nbundle exec jekyll serve\n```\n\nYou should now be able to access your local copy of RSQKit on <http://127.0.0.1:4000>.\n\n## Installing RSQKit using a Docker container\n\n**Prerequisites:** `docker` and `docker-compose`.\n\nTo install a Docker engine locally, follow the [official installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\nDocker Compose is available natively on Docker Desktop, as a Docker Engine plugin, and as a standalone tool - check [Compose installation\ninstructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for your setup.\n\nWe provide `docker-compose.yml` file for RSQKit container to help you set up.\n\nAfter successfully setting up `docker` and `docker-compose`, run the following commands.\n\n``` bash\ndocker-compose build\ndocker-compose up\n```\n\nYou should now be able to access your local copy of RSQKit on <http://127.0.0.1:4000>.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/main/INSTALL.md"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/blob/main/README.md", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/main/codemeta.json"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/main/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "authors": [{"result": {"value": "RSQKit community", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/RSQKit/main/codemeta.json"}], "code_of_conduct": [{"result": {"value": "## Code of Conduct\n\n### Disclaimer:\nThis document is still under discussion by the RSQKit governance body. This is draft proposal.\n\nThe RSQKit team are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.\nAs such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.\nWe do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.\n\nEveryone who participates in the RDMKit activities is required to conform to this Code of Conduct.\nThis Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the RDMkit including, but not limited to, in person focus groups and workshops, and communications online via GitHub.\nBy participating, contributors indicate their acceptance of the procedures by which the RDMkit project core development team resolves any Code of Conduct incidents, which may include storage and processing of their personal information.\n\n### Expected behaviour\n\nWe are confident that our community members will together build a supportive and collaborative atmosphere at our events and during online communications.\nThe following bullet points set out explicitly what we hope you will consider to be appropriate community guidelines:\n\n* **Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences**. Do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ageist, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.\n* **Use welcoming and inclusive language**. Exclusionary comments or jokes, threats or violent language are not acceptable. Do not address others in an angry, intimidating, or demeaning manner. Be considerate of the ways the words you choose may impact others. Be patient and respectful of the fact that English is a second (or third or fourth!) language for some participants.\n* **Do not harass people**. Harassment includes unwanted physical contact, sexual attention, or repeated social contact. Know that consent is explicit, conscious and continuous\u2014not implied. If you are unsure whether your behaviour towards another person is welcome, ask them. If someone tells you to stop, do so.\n* **Respect the privacy and safety of others**. Do not take photographs of others without their permission. Do not share other participant\u2019s personal experiences without their express permission. Note that posting (or threatening to post) personally identifying information of others without their consent (\"doxing\") is a form of harassment.\n* **Be considerate of others\u2019 participation**. Everyone should have an opportunity to be heard. In update sessions, please keep comments succinct so as to allow maximum engagement by all participants. Do not interrupt others on the basis of disagreement; hold such comments until they have finished speaking.\n* **Don\u2019t be a bystander**. If you see something inappropriate happening, speak up. If you don't feel comfortable intervening but feel someone should, please feel free to ask a member of the Code of Conduct response team for support.\n* **Do not gaslight**. Gaslighting is a tactic in which a person or entity, in order to gain more power, makes a victim question their reality. Sometimes you don't even know you are doing it. Look out for the signs in yourself and in others [5 tactics for gaslighting](https://www.psychologytoday.com/gb/blog/how-be-yourself/201801/how-recognize-5-tactics-gaslighting)\n* As an overriding general rule, please **be intentional in your actions and humble in your mistakes**.\n\nAll interactions should be professional regardless of platform: either online or in-person.\nSee [this explanation of the four social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) - no feigning surprise, no well-actually's, no back-seat driving, no subtle -isms - for further recommendations for inclusive behaviours.\n\n### Unacceptable behaviour\n\nExamples of unacceptable behaviour by the RDMkit community members at any project event or platform include:\n\n* written or verbal comments which have the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group\n* causing someone to fear for their safety, such as through stalking, following, or intimidation\n* violent threats or language directed against another person\n* the display of sexual or violent images\n* unwelcome sexual attention\n* non-consensual or unwelcome physical contact\n* sustained disruption of talks, events or communications\n* insults or put downs\n* sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes\n* excessive swearing\n* incitement to violence, suicide, or self-harm\n* continuing to initiate interaction (including photography or recording) with someone after being asked to stop\n* publication of private communication without consent\n* tactics that make a victim question their reality such as passive-aggressive and gaslighting behaviours\n\n### Consequences of unacceptable behaviour\n\nParticipants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.\nThis applies to all RDMKit community events and platforms, either online or in-person.\nIf a participant engages in behaviour that violates this Code of Conduct, any member of the core development team may warn the offender, ask them to leave the event or platform (without refund), or impose any other appropriate sanctions (see the [enforcement manual](#4-enforcement-manual) for details).\n\n<!--\n### 2.4 Feedback\n\nThis Code of Conduct is not intended as a static set of rules by which everyone must abide.\nRather, you are
