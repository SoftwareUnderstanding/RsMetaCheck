This was not correct behavior from a logical perspective - i.e., one would expect if an error occurred that thing they were trying to do did not stick around. The new behavior as of this version deletes the stub upon any error during its creation. Under the hood we're using `withCallingHandlers` to handle different types of errors, throw warnings, etc.\r\n\r\n### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* Partial matching. New functions `including()` and `excluding()` for use with `wi_th()` support partial for bodies and queries (header partial matching was already supported without any additional steps). See `?partial`. This makes it slightly to a whole lot easier to do matching depending on the HTTP request your trying to match (e.g., let's say you're trying to match against a query with 20 parameters - if you can match uniquely to it with 1 or 2 of those params, then you're all set) (#38)\r\n* Basic auth internal work for `RequestPattern`. Shouldn't change behavior (#133)\r\n* New features for supporting request body diffs. There are two ways to use request body diffing. First, you can toggle it on/off globally like `webmockr_configure(show_body_diff = TRUE)` or `webmockr_configure(show_body_diff = FALSE)`. Second, a new function `stub_body_diff()` is a standalone function that compares by default the last stub created and the last http request made - but you can pass in any stub and http request. Note that body diffing functionality requires the suggested package `diffobj` (#126)\r\n* As part of the above body diffing functionality, two new functions are offered: `last_request()` and `last_stub()`, which get the last http request made and the last webmockr stub created, respectively.  (#126)\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* Removed `global_stubs` field from the `StubRegistry` class as it was completely unused (holdover from the initial port from Ruby). Should not impact users at all. (#127)\r\n* Wider use of `rlang` functions throughout the package for nicer assertions and condition handling. This change alters the main error message you get when there's no match to registered stubs. Hopefully this feels like an improvement to you; let me know. (#129)\r\n* `StubRegistry` gains new method `is_stubbed()` to check if a stub is in the stub registry", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/tarball/v2.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/zipball/v2.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr/releases/tag/v2.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/199707748", "release_id": 199707748, "date_created": "2025-02-11T16:56:20Z", "date_published": "2025-02-11T20:36:28Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/166546446", "tag": "v1.0.0", "name": "webmockr v1.0.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* `webmockr` now supports the `httr2` library, in addition to `httr` and `crul`.

You can give more than one `to_return()` one creating a stub, or if you want to return the same response each time, you can use the new `times` parameter within `to_return()`. As a related use case (#31) you can mock http retry's using this new feature (#10) (#32) (#101)\n* Gains new function `webmockr_reset()` to be able to reset stub registry and request registry in one function call (#97) (#101)\n* Gains support for mocking simple authentication. `wi_th()` now accepts `basic_auth` in addition to query, body, and headers. Note that authentication type is ignored (#103)\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n\n* change to how URI's are matched in `stub_request()`: we weren't allowing matching URI's without schemes; you can now do that. In addition, webmockr can match URI's without the \"http\" scheme, but does not match if the scheme is \"https\". See `UriPattern` for more (#102)\n* another change to how URI's are matched: now query params compared separately to the URI; note that regex not allowed in query params (#104) - And now query parameters are compared with the same code both when regex uri is used and when it is not (#107)\n* URI matching for stubs is now done only on the URI's themselves; that is, query parameters are removed before comparison, so only the base url with http scheme, plus paths, are compared (#107)\n* wasn't sure `write_disk_path` behavior was correct when using httr, seems to be working, added tests for it (#79)\n* values for query parameters given to `wi_th()` are now all coerced to character class to make sure that all comparisons of stubs and requests are done with the same class (character) (#107)\n\n### BUG FIXES\n\n* fix for `uri_regex` usage in `stub_request()`: no longer curl escape the `uri_regex` given, only escape a non-regex uri (#106)\n\n\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/tarball/v0.7.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/zipball/v0.7.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr/releases/tag/v0.7.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/32001289", "release_id": 32001289, "date_created": "2020-09-30T16:15:46Z", "date_published": "2020-09-30T16:15:51Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/24826458", "tag": "v0.6.2", "name": "webmockr v0.6.2", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "* change to `CrulAdapter`: do not use `normalizePath` on the `write_disk_path` path so that relative paths are not changed to full paths - added tests for this (#95) (#96)", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/tarball/v0.6.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/zipball/v0.6.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr/releases/tag/v0.6.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/24826458", "release_id": 24826458, "date_created": "2020-03-24T19:07:19Z", "date_published": "2020-03-24T20:38:59Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/24116514", "tag": "v0.6.0", "name": "webmockr v0.6.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* new `Adapter` class to consolidate common code for the `HttrAdapter` and `CrulAdapter` classes, which inherit from `Adapter`; not a user facing change (#87)\r\n* pkgdown documentation site gains grouping of functions to help the user navigate the package: see https://docs.ropensci.org/webmockr/reference/ (#93)\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* now correctly fails with informative message when `write_disk_path` is `NULL` when the user is trying to write to disk while using webmockr (#78)\r\n* improve README construction; use html child for the details section (#81)\r\n* fix matching stub matching for bodies when bodies are JSON encoded (#82) \r\n* when vcr was loaded real HTTP requests were being performed twice when they should have only been performed once (#91) (#92)\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* fix for `set_body()` method in the `Response` class - handle cases where user writing to disk and not, and handle raw bytes correctly (#80)\r\n* fix to `to_s()` method in `StubbedRequest` class - was formatting query parameters incorrectly (#83)\r\n* fix to `BodyPattern` class to handle upload objects in a list; related issue fixed where `wi_th()` parameter `body` was not handling upload objects (#84) (#85)\r\n* httr requests were failing when vcr loaded, but with no cassette inserted; fixed `handle_request()` to skip vcr-related code unless a cassette is inserted (#86) (#88)", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/tarball/v0.6.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/zipball/v0.6.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/webmockr/releases/tag/v0.6.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/24116514", "release_id": 24116514, "date_created": "2020-03-02T02:16:55Z", "date_published": "2020-03-02T02:18:36Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/webmockr/releases/21978187", "tag": "v0.5.0", "name": "webmockr v0.5.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* `webmockr` now supports mocking writing to disk.
