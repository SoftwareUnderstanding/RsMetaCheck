principles governing the distribution\n    of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,\n  * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it\n    is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual\n    property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and\n    holders of the economic rights over software.\n\nThe authors

brought to\nthe user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it\ncomplicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for\ndevelopers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer\nknowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the\nsuitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions\nenabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,\nmore generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of\nsecurity. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,\nprovided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or\nremoved herefrom.\n\nThis Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of\nthe economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.\n\nFrequently asked questions can be found on the official website of the\nCeCILL licenses family (http://www.cecill.info/index.en.html) for any\nnecessary clarification.\n\n\n    Article 1 -
