However, due\nto the alteration of rainfall patterns worldwide from climate change,\nusing nonstationary distributions to calculate a nonstationary version\nof this drought index (NSPI) has become an important step to adjust for\npossible changing rainfall patterns (Park et al.\u00a02018). Previous\nstudies, however, have shown that interpreting NSPI estimates is not\nstraightforward, as time-varying parametric distributions remove the\neffect of rainfall trends on NSPI estimates (Shiau, 2020). Consequently,\nin the presence of decreasing (or increasing) rainfall trends, the NSPI\nmay underestimate (or overestimate) drought occurrence (Park et al.,\n2018; Shiau, 2020). \nThis package, based on the study of Blain et al.\u00a0(2022), demonstrates\nthat the challenge of interpreting SPI estimates under changing climatic\nconditions can be overcome by using information generated by the NSPI\ncalculation algorithm. This package uses nonstationary distributions to\ndetect trends in rainfall patterns and quantify their effect on the\noccurrence of specific SPI values. In other words, the {SPIChanges}\npackage leverages the nonstationary approach of the NSPI algorithm to\ndetect trends in rainfall series and enhance the understanding of how\nchanges in rainfall patterns affect the expected frequency of drought\noccurrence. With this background, the key function of this package -\n`SPIChanges()` - is based on the following steps: \n1.  Given a rainfall series with data accumulated at a particular time\n    scale, the package uses the stationary version of the two-parameter\n    gamma distribution to calculate SPI estimates and the cumulative\n    probability of each rainfall amount occurring (i.e., the probability\n    of each SPI estimate occurring). \n4.  The package compares the probabilities estimated in steps 1 and 3 to\n    indicate whether the frequency of drought or wet events, quantified\n    by the SPI, has increased or decreased over time.\n \n", "original_header": "Theoretical Background"}, "confidence": 0.9543390242845355, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielblain/SPIChanges/master/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "- daily.rain: Vector, 1-column matrix or data frame with daily rainfall\n  totals.\n- start.date: Date at which the aggregation should start.
