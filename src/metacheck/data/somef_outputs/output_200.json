documentation](https://grobid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Grobid-docker/). CRF-only image is recomended.\n\nTo install initialize the docker daemon and execute: \n```\ndocker pull lfoppiano/grobid:0.8.0\n```\n\nThen you should clone this repository locally with:\n```\ngit clone\n```\n\nFinally, you may need to install the necessary packages to run the code. In order to do this go to the github cloned repo through the CMD and go to the '/docs' folder (cd docs). Now just run:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n You can also install Gobrid\u00b4s client for python following the [instructions](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid_client_python).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/install.md"}], "requirements": [{"result": {"value": "et-xmlfile==1.1.0", "name": "et-xmlfile", "version": "==1.1.0", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/requirements.txt"}, {"result": {"value": "stop-words==2018.7.23", "name": "stop-words", "version": "==2018.7.23", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/requirements.txt"}, {"result": {"value": "matplotlib==3.7.1", "name": "matplotlib", "version": "==3.7.1", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/requirements.txt"}, {"result": {"value": "grobid_client == 0.8.5", "name": "grobid_client", "version": "== 0.8.5", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/requirements.txt"}, {"result": {"value": "sentence_transformers==2.7.0", "name": "sentence_transformers", "version": "==2.7.0", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/requirements.txt"}, {"result": {"value": "utils==1.0.2", "name": "utils", "version": "==1.0.2", "type": "Software_application"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/docs/requirements.txt"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "OpenScience"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/README.md"}], "related_documentation": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://grobid.readthedocs.io/", "format": "readthedocs"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrGG14/OpenScience/main/README.md"}]}
