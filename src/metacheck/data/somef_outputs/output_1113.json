In short, the `rfema`\npackage handles much of the grunt work associated with constructing API\nqueries, dealing with API limits, and applying filters or other\nparameters. Suppose one wants to obtain data on all of the flood\ninsurance claims in Florida for 2020. The following code obtains that\ndata without the use of the `rfema` package. As can be seen it requires\nquite a few lines of code, in part due to the API limiting calls to 1000\nrecords per call which can make obtaining a full data set cumbersome.\n``` r\n# Code needed to obtain data on flood insurance claims in FL without the rfema package ------------------\n\n# define the url for the appropriate api end point\nbase_url <- \"https://www.fema.gov/api/open/v2/FimaNfipClaims\"\n\n# append the base_url to apply filters\nfilters <- \"?$inlinecount=allpages&$filter=(state%20eq%20'FL')%20and%20(yearOfLoss%20eq%202020)\"\n\napi_query <- paste0(base_url, filters)\n\n# run a query setting the top_n parameter to 1 to check how many records match the filters\nrecord_check_query <- \"https://www.fema.gov/api/open/v2/FimaNfipClaims?$inlinecount=allpages&$top=1&$filter=(state%20eq%20'FL')%20and%20(yearOfLoss%20eq%202020)\"\n\n# run the api call and determine the number of matching records\nresult <- httr::GET(record_check_query)\njsonData <- httr::content(result)        \nn_records <- jsonData$metadata$count \n\n# calculate number of calls neccesary to get all records using the \n# 1000 records/ call max limit defined by FEMA\niterations <- ceiling(n_records / 1000)\n\n# initialize a skip counter which will indicate where in the full \n# data set each API call needs to start from.\nskip <- 0\n\n# make however many API calls are neccesary to get the full data set\nfor (i in seq(from = 1, to = iterations, by = 1)) {\n  # As above, if you have filters, specific fields, or are sorting, add\n  # that to the base URL or make sure it gets concatenated here.\n  result <- httr::GET(paste0(api_query, \"&$skip=\", (i - 1) * 1000))\n  if (result$status_code != 200) {\n    status <- httr::http_status(result)\n    stop(status$message)\n  }\n  json_data <- httr::content(result)[[2]]\n  \n  # for data returned as a list of lists, correct any discrepancies\n  # in the length of the lists by adding NA values to the shorter lists\n  \n  # calculate longest list\n  max_list_length <- max(sapply(json_data, length))\n  \n  # add NA values to lists shorter than the max list length\n  json_data <- lapply(json_data, function(x) {\n    c(x, rep(NA, max_list_length - length(x)))\n  })\n  \n  if (i == 1) {\n    # bind the data into a single data frame\n    data <- data.frame(do.call(rbind, json_data))\n  } else {\n    data <- dplyr::bind_rows(\n      data,\n      data.frame(do.call(rbind, json_data))\n    )\n  }\n}\n\n \n# remove the html line breaks from returned data frame (if there are any)  \ndata <- as_tibble(lapply(data, function(data) gsub(\"\\n\", \"\", data)))\n\n# view the retrieved data\ndata\n```\n \nCompare the above block of code to the following code which obtains the\nsame data using the `rfema` package. The `rfema` package allows the same\nrequest to be made with two lines of code. Notably, the `open_fema()`\nfunction handles checking the number of records and implements an\niterative loop to deal with the 1000 records/call limit.\n``` r\n# define a list of filters to apply\nfilterList <- list(state = \"FL\",yearOfLoss = \"= 2020\")\n\n# Make the API call using the `open_fema` function. The function will output a \n# status message to the console letting you monitor the progress of the data retrieval.\ndata <- open_fema(data_set = \"fimaNfipClaims\",ask_before_call = F, filters = filterList)\n\n# view data\ndata\n```\n \nThe `rfema` package also returns data, where possible, in formats that\nare easier to work with. For example, all functions return data as a\ntibble with all date columns converted to POSIX format. This makes\nplotting time series easy as the API call can be piped directly into a\n`ggplot` plot. For example, the following is a plot of the number of\nFEMA disaster declarations in response to hurricanes since 2010,\nseparated out by Florida versus the rest of the United States. In an\napplication where the most up to date data is required, this block of\ncode can be rerun to plot the most up to date data from the FEMA API.\n``` r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nopen_fema(\"DisasterDeclarationsSummaries\", \n                  filters = list(declarationDate = \">= 2010-01-01\",\n                                 incidentType = \"Hurricane\"), \n                  ask_before_call = F) %>% \n  mutate(date = lubridate::floor_date(declarationDate,\"year\"),count = 1,\n         Florida = factor(state == \"FL\")) %>%\n  select(date,count,Florida) %>%\n  group_by(date,Florida) %>%\n  summarise(count = sum(count)) %>%\n  ggplot(., aes(fill=Florida, y=count, x=date)) + \n    geom_bar(position=\"stack\", stat=\"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"\",values = c(\"grey80\",\"forestgreen\"),drop = FALSE,\n                    labels = c(\"Rest of U.S.\",\"Florida\")) +\n  labs(x = \"year\",y = \"\",\n       title = \"County Level FEMA Disaster Declarations for Hurricanes\") +\n  theme_light()\n```\n \n", "original_header": "Why rfema?"}, "confidence": 0.971236723001076, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rfema/main/README.rmd"}], "name": [{"result": {"value": "rfema", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "rfema: Access the openFEMA API", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rfema/main/codemeta.json"}], "full_name": [{"result": {"value": "ropensci/rfema", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "issue_tracker": [{"result": {"value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/rfema/issues", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "https://github.com/dylan-turner25/rfema/issues", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rfema/main/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "https://github.com/dylan-turner25/rfema/issues", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rfema/main/codemeta.json"}], "forks_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/rfema/forks", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "stargazers_count": [{"result": {"value": 11, "type": "Number"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "forks_count": [{"result": {"value": 3, "type": "Number"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "download_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/ropensci/rfema/releases", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "programming_languages": [{"result": {"value": "R", "name": "R", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 38168}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "TeX", "name": "TeX", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 1233}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"name": "R", "value": "R", "type": "Programming_language", "url": "https://r-project.org"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rfema/main/codemeta.json"}], "releases": [{"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/rfema/releases/57939308", "tag": "v1.0.0", "name": "v1.0.0", "author": {"name": "dylan-turner25", "type": "User"}, "description": "Initial release", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/rfema/tarball/v1.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/rfema/zipball/v1.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/rfema/releases/tag/v1.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/rfema/releases/57939308", "release_id": 57939308, "date_created": "2022-01-25T11:30:44Z", "date_published": "2022-01-25T16:45:52Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "license": [{"result": {"value": "# MIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2021 Dylan Turner\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

to visit the [FEMA API documentation\npage](https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets).

This is useful for\nexploring a data set without retrieving all records.\n\n``` r\n# obtain the first 10 records from the fimaNfipClaims data set.\n# Note: the data_set argument is not case sensitive\nretrieved_data <- open_fema(data_set = \"fimanfipclaims\", top_n = 10)\n\n# view the data\nretrieved_data\n```\n\n    ## # A tibble: 10 \u00d7 73\n    ##    agriculture\u2026\u00b9 asOfDate            basem\u2026\u00b2 polic\u2026\u00b3 crsCl\u2026\u2074 dateOfLoss         \n    ##    <chr>         <dttm>              <chr>   <chr>   <chr>   <dttm>             \n    ##  1 FALSE         2020-01-22 00:00:00 NULL    1       8       1998-02-07 00:00:00\n    ##  2 FALSE         2020-01-22 00:00:00 NULL    1       8       2005-08-29 00:00:00\n    ##  3 FALSE         2020-01-22 00:00:00 NULL    1       9       1998-09-28 00:00:00\n    ##  4 FALSE         2019-09-19 00:00:00 1       1       9       1994-10-07 00:00:00\n    ##  5 FALSE         2019-09-19 00:00:00 NULL    1       8       1996-03-11 00:00:00\n    ##  6 FALSE         2020-01-22 00:00:00 NULL    1       NULL    1998-02-03 00:00:00\n    ##  7 FALSE         2020-01-22 00:00:00 NULL    1       5       2017-08-27 00:00:00\n    ##  8 FALSE         2019-10-19 00:00:00 NULL    1       NULL    1992-09-11 00:00:00\n    ##  9 FALSE         2019-10-19 00:00:00 NULL    1       8       1998-09-28 00:00:00\n    ## 10 FALSE         2019-09-19 00:00:00 NULL    1       8       1995-03-11 00:00:00\n    ## # \u2026 with 67 more variables: elevatedBuildingIndicator <chr>,\n    ## #   elevationCertificateIndicator <chr>, elevationDifference <chr>,\n    ## #   baseFloodElevation <chr>, ratedFloodZone <chr>, houseWorship <chr>,\n    ## #   locationOfContents <chr>, lowestAdjacentGrade <chr>,\n    ## #   lowestFloorElevation <chr>, numberOfFloorsInTheInsuredBuilding <chr>,\n    ## #   nonProfitIndicator <chr>, obstructionType <chr>, occupancyType <chr>,\n    ## #   originalConstructionDate <dttm>, originalNBDate <dttm>, \u2026\n\nThere are a variety of other ways to more precisely target the data you\nwant to retrieve by specifying how many records you want returned,\nspecifying which columns in a data set to return, and applying filters\nto any of the columns in a data set.
