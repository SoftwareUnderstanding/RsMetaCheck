Current search algorithms are able to respond quickly and reliably on an audio query, even if there is noise or other distortions present. During the last decades they have been used successfully as digital music archive management tools, music identification services for smartphones or for digital rights management.  \n\nMost algorithms, as they are described in the literature, do not allow substantial changes in replay speed. The speed of the audio query needs to be the same as the reference audio for the current algorithms to work. This poses a problem, since changes in replay speed do occur commonly, they are either introduced by accident during an analog to digital conversion or are introduced deliberately.  \nThe Panako algorithm allows such changes while maintaining other desired features as scalability, robustness and reliability.  Next to the panako algorithm there is also an implementation of the algorithm described in \"An Industrial-Strength Audio Search Algorithm\":http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf (internally identified as Olaf).

Query for Matches - **@panako query@** \nThe @query@ command extracts fingerprints from a short audio frament and tries to match the fingerprints with the database. The incoming audio is, by default, chopped in parts of 25s with an overlap of 5s. So every @25-5=20s@ the database is queried and a result is printed to the command line. \nThis application checks the similarity of two files. The percentage returned indicates the percentage of seconds for which fingerprints match between the first and second file. So 100% that matches are found in every second. A result of 30% still means that much of the audio matches.  \nNote that this operation is performed in memory.

The main aim of this release is to ensure the longevity and maintainability of Panako. The featureset has been reduced to focus on core functionality. The version bump is also explained by the use of lambdas and the need for a newer JRE (8+). A list of changes: \n* The number of dependencies has been drastically cut by removing support for multiple key-value stores. \n* The key-value store has been changed to a faster and simpler system (from MapDB to LMDB). \n* The SyncSink functionality has been moved to another project (with Panako as dependency). \n* The main algorithms have been replaced with simpler and better working versions:\n** Olaf is a new implementation of the classic Shazam algorithm. \n** The algoritm described in the Panako paper was also replaced. The core ideas are still the same. The main change is the use of a \"Gabor transform\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor_transform to go from time domain to the spectral domain (previously a constant-q transform was used).  The gabor transform is implemented by \"JGaborator\":https://github.com/JorenSix/JGaborator which in turn relies on \"The Gaborator\":https://gaborator.com/ C++ library via JNI. \n* Folder structure has been simplified.\n* The UI, which was mainly used for debugging, has been removed.\n* A new set of helper scripts are added in the @scripts@ directory. They help with evaluation, parsing results, checking results, building panako, creating documentation,...\n* Changed the default panako location to ~/.panako, so users can install and use panako more easily (withouth need for sudo rights) \n", "original_header": "Results are parsed."}, "confidence": 0.8919947118352963, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlsquared/Panako_Adjusted/main/README.textile"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "Panako is an \"acoustic fingerprinting\":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_fingerprint system. The system is able to extract fingerprints from an audio stream, and either store those fingerprints in a database, or find a match between the extracted fingerprints and stored fingerprints.

It is expressed in seconds.\n* *Query stop (s)* The matching part of the query with the reference stops at this point in the query. It is expressed in seconds.\n* *Match path* The path of the matching file.\n* *Match id* The internal identifier of the matching file. If the filename contains only digits then it equals the file name (as is the case here). Otherwise it is a hash of the filename.\n* *Match start (s)* The matching part of the query with the reference starts at this point in the reference. It is expressed in seconds.\n* *Match stop (s)* The matching part of the query with the reference stops at this point in the reference. It is expressed in seconds.\n* *Match score* The number of matching fingerprints between query and reference. The number of fingerprints per second can be calculated by dividing by the match duration.\n* *Time factor (%)* How much faster the query is with respect to the reference.\n* *Frequency factor(%)* How much higher in pitch the query is with respect to the reference. If the query is sped up the time factor is expected to be nearly equal to the frequency factor.\n* *Seconds with match (%)*  The number of seconds for which matches are found. If in each matching second a match is found, then this number is 1. A low ratio might indicate a false positive. \n\nFor the test queries the start of the match is encoded into the filename. Likewise for the speed-up factor and matching identifier. For example @queries/557132_97_104.wav@ expects to match the file with identifier @557132@ starting from second 97 at a speed up of 104%. When looking at the result this closely matches what is reported.\n\nSee below for a \"full evaluation of Panako\":#eval. The evaluation tests retrieval rates for various factors of pitch-shifting, time-stretching, speed-up and some audio effects.\n\nh2(#test). Benchmarking Panako \n\nTo get an idea on the speed and scalability of panako, there is a \"benchmark script\":./resources/scripts/benchmark/benchmark.rb and some more \"information on benchmarking panako and how to run the benchmark yourself\":./resources/scripts/benchmark/benchmark.textile.\n\nh2(#docker). Panako and Docker \n\nPanako can also be ran in a containerized environment. A @Dockerfile@ is provided which should both work on @x86_64@ as @aarch64@. To build the container and run commands the following should get you started. Note that the database with fingerprints is located on the host at @~/.panako/docker@:\n\nTo access audio files relative paths are given with respect to the current directory on the host. Watch out with absolute (host) paths, these will not work correctly.\n\nbc. docker build -t panako:2.1 resources/scripts/\nmkdir -p $HOME/.panako/docker\nwget \"https://filesamples.com/samples/audio/mp3/sample3.mp3\"", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "apt-get install sox wget"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlsquared/Panako_Adjusted/main/README.textile"}], "application_domain": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Semantic web"}, "confidence": 0.9614120895344161, "technique": "supervised_classification"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "\"Why Panako?\":#why"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mlsquared/Panako_Adjusted/main/README.textile"}]}
