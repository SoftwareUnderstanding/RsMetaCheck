Removed \"collections.go and collections_test.go\" from repository (redundent code). Updated libdataset/libdataset.go to hold functions that were needed for the C-Shared library from collections.go. The Namaste fields in the collection's metadata are now depreciated.\r\n\r\nThe dataset.Init() now places a lock file in the collection directory and leves the collection in an \"Open\" state, it should be explicitly closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nE.g. \r\n\r\n```\r\n   c, err := dataset.Init(\"MyData.ds\")\r\n   ...\r\n   defer c.Close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nRemoved \"set_*\" for collection metadata fields from libdataset.go. These should be set using the dataset command line tool only.\r\n\r\nThe dataset.Analzyer() and dataset.Repair() commands expect the dataset collections to be closed before being called. E.g..\r\n\r\n```\r\n    c, err := dataset.Open(\"MyData.ds\")\r\n    ...\r\n    c.Close()\r\n    err := dataset.Analyzer(\"MyData.ds\", true)\r\n    if err == nil {\r\n        c, err =

FrameRefresh now only refreshes object in frame pruning objects no longer found in the collection. FrameReframe requires a key list and replaces of the object map and key list in a frame. libdataset splits out the functionality of the command line \"keys\" verb. keys() returns all keys in a collectin, key_filter() is used to filter a key list, key_sort() is used to sort a key list.\r\n\r\nEnvoking most libdataset functions will automatically open a collection if needed. There are some additional functions including support for most getting and setting Namaste nouns about the collection (e.g. Who, What).\r\nCollections versions can be set and retrieved.  Getting the dataset version via libdataset now uses the function dataset_verison() while getting the version of a collection uses get_version().\r\n\r\nlibdataset now has tests via using a custom libdataset Python module. This proved easier then writing C code to test the C-Shared library.\r\n\r\nFinally Google Sheets support has been removed. Directory S3 support will likely be removed in a future version. This will allow us to continue to trim the fat before making it to v1.x.\r\n\r\nNOTE: this release lacks a libdataset.dll for Windows 10.", "tarball_url":

The first will replace, add and re-oder objects given a list of keys, the second will update objects and append new objects given a list of keys\r\n+ The delete-frame verb has been renamed frame-delete to be consistent with the rest of the frame commands\r\n+ Experimental support for running check and repair directly on S3 hosted dataset collections\r\n+ Experimental support in libdataset for operating on open collections with out requiring an explicit close, and managing writes to the collection.json file and pairtree. This allows us to open many collections and manage them in a service context like a Python application providing web interactions\r\n\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/tarball/v0.1.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/zipball/v0.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/tag/v0.1.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/21563149", "release_id": 21563149, "date_created": "2019-11-18T18:08:22Z", "date_published": "2019-11-18T19:09:05Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241108", "name": "dataset-v0.1.0-linux-amd64.zip", "content_size": 10007570, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/dataset-v0.1.0-linux-amd64.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T18:50:10Z", "download_count": 10}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241109", "name": "dataset-v0.1.0-macosx-amd64.zip", "content_size": 9830663, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/dataset-v0.1.0-macosx-amd64.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T18:50:10Z", "download_count": 12}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241110", "name": "dataset-v0.1.0-raspbian-arm7.zip", "content_size": 9182209, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/dataset-v0.1.0-raspbian-arm7.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T18:50:11Z", "download_count": 12}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241111", "name": "dataset-v0.1.0-windows-amd64.zip", "content_size": 9778001, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/dataset-v0.1.0-windows-amd64.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T18:50:11Z", "download_count": 10}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241112", "name": "libdataset-v0.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz", "content_size": 10406812, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/libdataset-v0.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/gzip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T18:50:11Z", "download_count": 8}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241452", "name": "libdataset-v0.1.0-macosx-amd64.tar.gz", "content_size": 10843655, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/libdataset-v0.1.0-macosx-amd64.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/gzip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T19:08:56Z", "download_count": 9}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/16241280", "name": "libdataset-v0.1.0-windows-amd64.tar.gz", "content_size": 9770510, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.1.0/libdataset-v0.1.0-windows-amd64.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/x-gzip", "upload_date": "2019-11-18T19:02:19Z", "download_count": 11}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/20083597", "tag": "v0.0.70", "name": "Performance improvement", "author": {"name": "rsdoiel", "type": "User"}, "description": "Performance improvement for object creation.

You can get a Grid from a data frame by using the Grid() function on the frame. Added func Objects() to frame for returning a copy of the DataFrame.ObjectList values.  Updated libdataset to reflect this change adding both Objects() and Grid() funcs. Labels MUST be provided in the frame definition now. The dot paths and labels lengths must match. If the first element of the dopaths is NOT ._Key it will be prefixed to the dot path list automatically and a \"_Key\" label will be prefixed to the labels list before generating the frame. \"._Key\" and \"_Key\" will always be the first in the  list of dot paths and labels. This is less critical as the Grid 2D array has been dropped but it is always reflected in the output of the Grid function since the definitions of dot paths and labels enforce this.\r\n\r\nThe command line dataset has been updated to reflect the changes in frame definition requirements. In order to manage the command line arguments the you form the label/dot path pair by joining them with an equal sign.\r\nLabels are used as the keys in the objects of a frame while the dot path specifies where the value comes from in the collection's JSON objects.  This makes a command line frame definition looks something like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n    cat keys.txt | dataset frame collection.ds MyFrame one=.title two=.family_name three=.given_name\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe frame \"MyFrame\" will contain an object list with the keys of \"one\", \"two\" and \"three\" with values from\r\nthe dot paths \".title, .family_name, .given_name\".\r\n\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/tarball/v0.0.64", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/zipball/v0.0.64", "html_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/tag/v0.0.64", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/18218471", "release_id": 18218471, "date_created": "2019-06-25T19:08:57Z", "date_published": "2019-06-25T22:02:18Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13396940", "name": "dataset-v0.0.64-linux-amd64.zip", "content_size": 10160678, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/dataset-v0.0.64-linux-amd64.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T18:54:04Z", "download_count": 12}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13396941", "name": "dataset-v0.0.64-macosx-amd64.zip", "content_size": 10050116, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/dataset-v0.0.64-macosx-amd64.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T18:54:04Z", "download_count": 16}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13396942", "name": "dataset-v0.0.64-raspbian-arm7.zip", "content_size": 9375111, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/dataset-v0.0.64-raspbian-arm7.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T18:54:04Z", "download_count": 10}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13396943", "name": "dataset-v0.0.64-windows-amd64.zip", "content_size": 9946078, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/dataset-v0.0.64-windows-amd64.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T18:54:04Z", "download_count": 13}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13398091", "name": "libdataset-v0.0.64-linux-amd64.tar.gz", "content_size": 10473258, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/libdataset-v0.0.64-linux-amd64.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/gzip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T20:02:28Z", "download_count": 9}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13398635", "name": "libdataset-v0.0.64-macosx-amd64.tar.gz", "content_size": 10991132, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/libdataset-v0.0.64-macosx-amd64.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/x-gzip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T20:29:40Z", "download_count": 10}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/assets/13398552", "name": "libdataset-v0.0.64-windows-amd64.tar.gz", "content_size": 9778334, "content_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/download/v0.0.64/libdataset-v0.0.64-windows-amd64.tar.gz", "encoding_format": "application/x-gzip", "upload_date": "2019-06-25T20:24:18Z", "download_count": 10}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/dataset/releases/17894406", "tag": "v0.0.63", "name": "Release candidate 2, for v1.0.0", "author": {"name": "rsdoiel", "type": "User"}, "description": "Added boolean clean object to Read() and ReadList().

In particular how Mac OS X currently handles (by default) case assignment in paths versus other OS.  When migrating a dataset collection between OS/File system types via zip or tar ball it is a good idea to run `dataset check` and `dataset repair` on the destination system. For pairtree layouts repair will not keep track of the missing JSON records then walk the pair tree and re-attach those it finds fixing the path issue.

Here's a general guide on how to do it:\n\n1. **Download the Executable**: First, download the unsigned executable file you want to install.\n\n2. **Locate the File**: Use Finder to locate the downloaded file. It's often in the `Downloads` folder unless you specified a different location.\n\n3. **Attempt to Open the File**: Double-click the file to open it. macOS will likely show a warning that the file cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.\n\n4. **Override Security Settings**:\n   - **Option 1: Open via Context Menu**\n     - Right-click (or Control-click) the file.\n     - Select `Open` from the context menu.\n     - You'll see another warning, but this time there will be an option to `Open` the file anyway. Click `Open`.\n\n   - **Option 2: Allow Apps from Anywhere (Temporarily)**\n     - Open `System Preferences` and go to `Security & Privacy`.\n     - Click the lock icon in the bottom left corner and enter your password to make changes.\n     - Under the `General` tab, you might see a message about the app being blocked. Click `Open Anyway`.\n     - If you don't see this option, you can temporarily change the setting to allow apps downloaded from `Anywhere`. However, this option is not available in the latest versions of macOS by default. You may need to use the Terminal to do this:\n       - Open Terminal and type: `sudo spctl --master-disable`\n       - Press Enter and provide your password.\n       - This will allow you to run apps from anywhere, but it's recommended to re-enable security by typing `sudo spctl --master-enable` after installing your app.\n\n5. **Use Terminal (Advanced Users)**: If the above methods don't work, you can use the Terminal to run the executable directly:\n   - Open Terminal.\n   - Navigate to the directory where the file is located using the `cd` command.\n   - Make the file executable by typing: `chmod +x filename`\n   - Run the file by typing: `./filename`\n\n6. **Check for Updates**: Sometimes, developers will sign their apps later. Check if there's a signed version available to avoid these steps in the future.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Security Risks**: Running unsigned executables can expose your system to malware and other security risks. Only proceed if you trust the source of the software.\n- **System Integrity Protection (SIP)**: Some steps might be restricted by SIP, which is designed to protect your system. Disabling SIP is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIf you're unsure about any of these steps or the safety of the file, it's best to consult with someone who has more experience with macOS or to contact the software developer for support.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/main/INSTALL_NOTES_macOS.md"}, {"result": {"value": "\nInstalling an unsigned executable on Windows can also pose security risks, as Windows has built-in mechanisms to protect users from potentially harmful software. Here's a general guide on how to do it:\n\n### Steps to Install an Unsigned Executable on Windows\n\n1. **Download the Executable**: Download the unsigned executable file you want to install from a trusted source.\n\n2. **Locate the File**: Use File Explorer to locate the downloaded file, which is often in the `Downloads` folder unless you specified a different location.\n\n3. **Attempt to Open the File**: Double-click the file to open it. Windows may show a warning that the file is not commonly downloaded and could harm your computer.\n\n4. **Override Security Settings**:\n   - **Option 1: Run Anyway**\n     - When you see the warning, click on `More info` in the dialog box.\n     - A new option will appear to `Run anyway`. Click this to proceed with the installation.\n\n   - **Option 2: Disable Windows Defender SmartScreen (Temporarily)**\n     - Open the Start menu and go to `Settings`.\n     - Navigate to `Update & Security` > `Windows Security` > `App & browser control`.\n     - Under `Check apps and files`, select `Off`. This will disable SmartScreen temporarily.\n     - Try running the executable again.\n     - Remember to turn SmartScreen back on after installation for continued protection.\n\n5. **Use Command Prompt (Advanced Users)**: If the above methods don't work, you can use the Command Prompt to run the executable directly:\n   - Open Command Prompt as an administrator.\n   - Navigate to the directory where the file is located using the `cd` command.\n   - Run the file by typing its name and pressing Enter.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Security Risks**: Running unsigned executables can expose your system to malware and other security risks. Only proceed if you trust the source of the software.\n- **User Account Control (UAC)**: UAC might prompt you for permission to run the executable. Ensure you have administrative rights to proceed.\n- **Antivirus Software**: Your antivirus software might also block unsigned executables.
