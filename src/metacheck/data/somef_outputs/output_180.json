or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at package's \nmaintainer email. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and \nfairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\nreporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining\nthe consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate.

This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent\nban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\ncommunity.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0,\navailable at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/\ncode_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
