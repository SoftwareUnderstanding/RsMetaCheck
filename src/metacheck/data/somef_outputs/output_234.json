This results in files being systematically grouped for further processing. Customized parsers are then utilized to extract metadata from these categorized groups, compiling the data into a well-organized JSON format. \nWe currently support a variety of parsers, including VTK, HDF5, CFF, BibTeX, YAML and JSON:  \nIn the subsequent `Curator` phase, `harvester-curator` aligns the harvested metadata with the metadata schemas of the target repository, such as DaRUS. It matches the harvested metadata attributes with those defined in the metadata schemas and integrates the values into the appropriate locations. Additionally, it supports direct upload of curated metadata to the destination repository.  \nThe `Curator` algorithm employs mappings to reconcile discrepancies between the naming conventions of harvested metadata and the metadata schemas of the target repository. Given that harvested metadata typically features a flat structure -- where attributes, values, and paths are at the same level, unlike the hierarchical organization common in repository schemas\u2014-the algorithm adapts harvested metadata to ensure compatibility: \n1. **Mapping and Matching:** It begins by updating attribute values and paths of harvested metadata based on predefined mappings, taking into account the hierarchical structure of repository schemas.\n2. **Attribute Matching:** The algorithm searches for matching attributes within the target repository's schema. If no direct match is found, it combines parent and attribute information in search of a suitable match. Attributes that remain unmatched are noted for subsequent matching attempts with an alternative schema. \n3. **Parent Matching:** Upon finding a match, the algorithm designates the corresponding parent from the schema as the \"matching parent.\" If a direct parent match does not exist, or if multiple matches are found, it examines common elements between the schema and harvested metadata to determine the most appropriate matching parent.\n4. **Dictionary Preparation:** Attributes that successfully match are compiled into a dictionary that includes the mapped attribute, value, parent, and schema name, ensuring the metadata is compatible with the target repository.\n5. **Similarity Matching:** When exact matches are not found across all schemas, the algorithm employs similarity matching with an 85% threshold to accommodate differences in metadata schema integration. \nThis systematic approach ensures compatibility with the requirements of the target repository and enhances the precision of metadata integration by utilizing direct mapping, exact matching and similarity matching to overcome schema alignment challenges. \n", "original_header": "Tool Workflow"}, "confidence": 0.9385372356841222, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "The `harvester-curator` project is organized as follows: \n* `src/harvester_curator/`: The main app package directory containing all the source code.\n* `tests/`: Contains all tests for the `harvester-curator` application.\n* `images/`: Contains images used in the documentation, such as the workflow diagram. \n", "original_header": "Project Structure"}, "confidence": 0.8767013860201307, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/master/README.md"}], "name": [{"result": {"value": "harvester-curator", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "harvester-curator", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/master/codemeta.json"}], "full_name": [{"result": {"value": "SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "issue_tracker": [{"result": {"value": "https://api.github.com/repos/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/issues", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "forks_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://api.github.com/repos/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/forks", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "download_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/releases", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "programming_languages": [{"result": {"value": "Python", "name": "Python", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 112975}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "TeX", "name": "TeX", "type": "Programming_language", "size": 754}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"name": "Python", "value": "Python", "type": "Programming_language"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator/master/codemeta.json"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "# This CITATION.cff file was generated with cffinit.\n# Visit https://bit.ly/cffinit to generate yours today!\n\ncff-version: 1.2.0\ntitle: harvester-curator\nmessage: >-\n  If you use this software, please cite it using the\n  metadata from this file.\ntype: software\nauthors:\n  - given-names: Sarbani\n    family-names: Roy\n    email: sarbani.roy@simtech.uni-stuttgart.de\n  - given-names: FangFang\n    family-names: Wang\n    email: fangfang.wang@simtech.uni-stuttgart.de\nidentifiers:\n  - type: url\n    value: >-\n      https://github.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator\nrepository-code: >-\n  https://github.com/SimTech-Research-Data-Management/harvester-curator\nabstract: >-\n  Harvester-Curator is a tool, designed to elevate metadata\n  provision in data repositories.
