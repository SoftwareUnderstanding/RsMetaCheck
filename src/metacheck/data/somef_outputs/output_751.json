There are also four subfolders, each specifying an integrator and a load condition. Running the code in these folders with the Julia environment activated should generate files that are identical (plus or minus some differences related to operating systems and chip architecture) to the files that I created, which are stored on [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10926006).
