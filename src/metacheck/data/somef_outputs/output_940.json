This is the base class from which all the different distributions (`PowerLaw`, `BrokenPowerLaw` etc..) inherit;\r\n\r\n* @dimaniad6 additionally implemented an `InterpolatedDistribution` to read an arbitrary input particle distribution (two arrays: one for of Lorentz factors and the other for densities);\r\n\r\n* the `Blob` class has been improved:\r\n    - the different initialisation method available under the `spectrum_norm_type` argument of the `Blob` are now implemented in the base `ParticleDistribution` class. I.e. one can initialise `from_total_density`, `from_total_energy_density`, `from_density_at_gamma_1`, `from_total_energy`;\r\n    - several quantities are now provided as `properties` and are evaluated on the fly from the base parameters ( $R_b$, $z$, $\\delta_D$, $\\Gamma$, $B$);\r\n\r\n* the other classes remain largely unchanged. They have just been modified internally to deal with the new definition of particle distributions;\r\n\r\n* note that the prefactor of the particle distribution has been renamed from `k_e` to `k`, as we are not describing exclusively electrons distributions now. This means that the corresponding parameter in the fit classes is `log10_k` instead of `log10_k_e`.\r\n\r\n\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cosimoNigro/agnpy/tarball/v0.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cosimoNigro/agnpy/zipball/v0.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/cosimoNigro/agnpy/releases/tag/v0.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/cosimoNigro/agnpy/releases/83404931", "release_id": 83404931, "date_created": "2022-11-17T13:10:43Z", "date_published": "2022-11-17T14:44:53Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/cosimoNigro/agnpy/releases/75105352", "tag": "v0.2.0", "name": "v0.2.0: incorporated sherpa and Gammapy wrappers", "author": {"name": "cosimoNigro", "type": "User"}, "description": "In this release, the sherpa and Gammapy wrapper - that before were simple examples in the documentation - have been added to the source code.\r\n\r\nA `agnpy.fit` module has been introduced with two physical scenarios:\r\n\r\n* `SycnhrotronSelfComptonModel`, representing the sum of synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) radiation.
