By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom\nto share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains\nfree software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use\nthe GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies\nalso to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply\nit to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you\nhave certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom\nof others.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\nDevelopers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\nFor the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\nSome devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the\nmanufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the\naim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The\nsystematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for\nindividuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.\nTherefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the\npractice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in\nother domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those\ndomains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the\nfreedom of users.\n\nFinally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish\nto avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program\ncould make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL\nassures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n#### 0. Definitions.\n\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds\nof works, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense. Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of\nan exact copy. The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of\nthe earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user\nthrough a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not\nconveying.\n\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\" to\nthe extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n#### 1. Source Code.\n\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. \"Object code\" means any non-source form of\na work.\n\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form. A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities. However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can\nregenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.\n\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same\nwork.\n\n#### 2. Basic Permissions.\n\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey,\nwithout conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force.\nYou may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having\nthem make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with\nfacilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the\nterms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not\ncontrol copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for\nyou must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and\ncontrol, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your\ncopyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the\nconditions stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes\nit unnecessary.\n\n#### 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such\ncircumvention is effected by exercising rights under this License with\nrespect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit\noperation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against\nthe work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures.\n\n#### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these\nconditions:\n\n-   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n-   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under\n    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4\n    to \"keep intact all notices\".\n-   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n-   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of\nsections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable\nCorresponding Source under the terms of this License, in one of these\nways:\n\n-   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n-   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding\n    Source from a network server at no charge.\n-   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n-   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge. You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n-   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,\n    provided you inform other peers where the object code and\n    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general\n    public at no charge under subsection 6d.\n\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal,\nfamily, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for\nincorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a\nconsumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of\ncoverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,\n\"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of\nproduct, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way\nin which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected\nto use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of\nwhether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or\nnon-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant\nmode of use of the product.\n\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to\ninstall and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User\nProduct from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The\ninformation must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of\nthe modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with\nsolely because modification has been made.\n\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or\nupdates for a work that has been modified or installed by the\nrecipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or\ninstalled. Access to a network may be denied when the modification\nitself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network\nor violates the rules and protocols for communication across the\nnetwork.\n\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n#### 7. Additional Terms.\n\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders\nof that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n-   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n-   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n-   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,\n    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n-   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors\n    or authors of the material; or\n-   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n-   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions\n    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,\n    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly\n    impose on those licensors and authors.\n\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the\nabove requirements apply either way.\n\n#### 8. Termination.\n\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license\nfrom a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,\nunless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally\nterminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder\nfails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to\n60 days after the cessation.\n\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run\na copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License. For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n#### 11. Patents.\n\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned\nor controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version. For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement). To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients. \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the\nscope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on\nthe non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically\ngranted under this License. You may not convey a covered work if you\nare a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the\nbusiness of distributing software, under which you make payment to the\nthird party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the\nwork, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties\nwho would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent\nlicense (a) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by\nyou (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in\nconnection with specific products or compilations that contain the\ncovered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent\nlicense was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n#### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under\nthis License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to\nterms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying\nfrom those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could\nsatisfy both those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely\nfrom conveying the Program.\n\n#### 13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n#### 14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU General Public License from time to time. Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in\ndetail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public\nLicense \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of\nfollowing the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or\nof any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of the GNU General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version ever published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.\n\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions\nof the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's public\nstatement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to\nchoose that version for the Program.\n\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT\nWARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR\nA PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n        it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n        the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n        (at your option) any later version.\n\n        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper\nmail.\n\nIf the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n        <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n        This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n        This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n        under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands \\`show w' and \\`show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, your\nprogram's commands might be different; for a GUI interface, you would\nuse an \"about box\".\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

projects and we are happy about all forms of external contributions.\nHere are many easy things that you can do, like\n\n* read the documentation and tell us where and how it should be improved,\n* try to install DuMu<sup>x</sup> on your platform and report bugs if it doesn\u2019t work,\n* fix bugs and open merge requests or send us patches.\n\nIf you decide to contribute code please read this contribution guide.\n\n## Style guide\nWhen contributing code to DuMu<sup>x</sup> please follow the [style guide](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/blob/master/doc/styleguide.md). Your work will enjoy much smoother sailing if you stick to it with your changes. DuMu<sup>x</sup> is a pretty large project, and a consistent way of doing things really helps a lot when trying to find your way around the code.\n\n## Making changes\n\nYou should get your changes to us in the following way:\n\n* Get an account for our GitLab instance (you might need to contact us if you can't create projects at first login).\n* Fork the core module that you want to contribute to, just as you would do on GitHub.\n* Push your changes to your fork on some branch.\n* Open a merge request using the branch you pushed your changes to as the source branch and the master of the DuMu<sup>x</sup> repository\n  as the target branch. GitLab will usually ask you about opening a merge request if you browse it right after pushing to some branch.\n* Follow the discussion on the merge request to see what improvements should be done to the branch before merging.\n* If you have developer status you don't need to do a fork and you can create branches directly.\n\nIf you have any questions or complaints about this workflow of contributing to DuMu<sup>x</sup>, please ask on the [DuMu<sup>x</sup> support channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!dKKvOPMFJwyhekAKbj:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=gitter.im&via=matrix.sp-codes.de) or the [DuMu<sup>x</sup> mailing list](https://listserv.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/dumux).\n\n## Git\n* Use Git to your advantage!\n* Check out this [great tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository) in order to learn how to use it.\n* Also check out [Dune's Git best practices](https://www.dune-project.org/doc/guides/git_best_practices/).\n* Everything should compile after every single commit.\n* Make small commits with changes limited to a single issue / change.\n* Format commit messages as follows:\n\n    ```\n    [topic] Add brief description of the change\n\n    Long description containing the status quo,\n    the changes the commit introduces and why.\n    ```\n\n    where `topic` is usually a foldername, `[assembly]`, a model `[2p2c]`, or any other topic, e.g. `[cmake]`.\n    For consistency and brevity use imperative `Add`/`Change`/`Improve`/`Remove` etc. instead of other verb forms like `Added`/`Adding`.\n\n* Use `git rebase -i master` to update branches to the changes on the master branch.\n* Feature branches should be called `feature/my-bla-feature`.\n* Bugfix branches should be called `fix/issue-554`.\n* Cleanup branches should be called `cleanup/remove-deprecated-bla`.\n* Use lower case letters only, and hyphens to separate things.\n* In case multiple authors have contributed to a single commit, list co-authors at the end of the commit message as\n\n    ```\n    [topic] Brief description\n\n    Long description\n\n    Co-authored-by: John Doe <john@doe.com>\n    Co-authored-by: Max More <max.more@bla.org>\n    ```\n\n## GitLab\n* Open issues for bugs / discussions / feature requests.\n* Give issues a meaningful title, focus each issue on a single topic, describe what the problem is and what you tried.\n* Open merge request for changes to be merged into master or other branches. Pushing to master is disabled.\n* Give merge requests a meaningful title, describe what the problem is, how this is fixed with this merge request.\n* If you don't have the permissions to open branches, you might have permissions to do a fork in your own GitLab namespace and open a merge request from your fork into the dumux repository.\n* Merge requests get reviewed by at least one main developer.\n* If continuous integration (GitLabCI / BuildBot) is enabled for merge requests, the pipeline has to pass before merging anything to master.\n\n## Backwards Compatibility\nAs a general rule, all changes added to the dumux master version should be made\nsuch that:\n*  all tests and modules using dumux will still compile, and\n*  the user is warned at compile time of any interface changes.\n\nThis can be done by masking removed methods with deprecation warnings: (example 1)\n\n```c++\n[[deprecated(\"This method will be removed after release (3.n). Use newMethod(x,y,z) instead!\")]]\nint oldMethod(const int x, const int y) const\n{ return x + y; }\n\nint newMethod(const int x, const int y, const int z) const\n{ return x + y > z ? x + y : z; }\n```\n\nor by adding intermediate method calls with warnings guarded by isValid\nin the [`dumux/common/deprecated.hh`](dumux/common/deprecated.hh) header: (example 2)\n\n```c++\n// support old interface of the coolMethod() function on problems\ntemplate<class B>\nstruct HasNewCoolMethodIF\n{ template<class A> auto operator()(A&& a) -> decltype( a.coolMethod(std::declval<const B>()) ) {} };\n\ntemplate<class A, class B\n         typename std::enable_if_t<!decltype(isValid(HasNewCoolMethodIF<B>()).template check<A>())::value, int> = 0>\n[[deprecated(\"Use new coolMethod() interface that additionally receives\n              the object b! This will be removed after 3.n release\")]]\nauto coolMethod(const A a, const B b)\n{ return a.coolMethod(); }\n\ntemplate<class A, class B,\n         typename std::enable_if_t<decltype(isValid(HasNewCoolMethodIF<B>()).template check<A>())::value, int> = 0>\nauto coolMethod(const A a, const B b)\n{ return a.coolMethod(b); }\n```\nand replace the call with:\n\n```c++\nDeprecated::coolMethod(a, b); //TODO: Replace this after release 3.n\n```\n\nThere are other methods for deprecating old interfaces, please see [ (cppref/deprecated) ](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes/deprecated) for more information.\n\nIn addition, please be sure to:\n\n*  mark all deprecated interfaces with the release after which the deprecated interface will be removed, and\n*  add a detailed description of the changes made to the [changelog](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n**In some more complicated cases,** guaranteeing backwards compatibility for all possible\ncases is not feasible, or would require enormous intrusive changes.  In this case, we recommend you do the following:\n1.  Organize all changes neatly in a merge request.\n2.  Include a detailed description of the changes in the changelog.\n3.  Within the comments section of the merge request, mark one of the core developers,\n and document the reasons why guaranteeing backwards compatibility would not be feasible, and which cases will likely be effected.\n1.  The core developers will decide if the changes and efforts are sufficient during the next monthly core developers meeting (aka DumuxDay).\n2.  Should your efforts be deemed sufficient, continue with the standard MR procedure.\n\n## Patches\n\n* Patches can be supplied via the mailing list,\n* should be formatted with git format-patch.\n* We recommend using GitLab to provide patches in the form of a merge request (fork workflow).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dumux/dumux/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "[![Dumux support matrix](https://img.shields.io/matrix/dumux-support:matrix.org.svg?label=Dumux%20Support%20@%20Matrix)](https://matrix.to/#/!dKKvOPMFJwyhekAKbj:matrix.org?via=matrix.org&via=gitter.im&via=matrix.sp-codes.de)\n[![list](https://img.shields.io/badge/Dumux_Mailing_list-Subscribe_now-brightgreen)](https://listserv.uni-stuttgart.de/mailman/listinfo/dumux)\n\nContributions are highly welcome.

Installing DuMux and DUNE via script\n\nThis installation method requires\n\n* `wget` (for automatically downloading dependencies)\n* `git` (for cloning the code repositories)\n* `python3` (>= 3.7)\n\nWe provide you with a Python script that facilitates setting up a Dune/DuMux directory\ntree and configures all modules using CMake. Download [installdumux.py](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/blob/master/bin/installdumux.py) and place it in a directory where you want to install Dune/DuMux, for example by running\n\n```bash\nwget https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/raw/master/bin/installdumux.py\n```\n\nExecuting the script creates a folder \"dumux\" in which all dependencies will be downloaded and built.\nRun the script by typing:\n\n```bash\npython3 installdumux.py\n```\n\nFollow the instructions printed after the script has completed successfully to verify everything works as expected.\n\nIn brief, the script performs the following steps:\n\n* create a folder \"dumux\"\n* clone the DUNE core modules in the current release version\n* clone the DuMux module\n* configure DUNE and DuMux with CMake by using the script `dune-common/bin/dunecontrol` and the options in `dumux/cmake.opts`\n* build the DUNE and DuMux libraries using CMake and generated GNU Makefiles\n\nNote that this process can take several minutes. The next section will guide\nyou through the same process providing the necessary commands for executing each step.\nThe installation is fully contained in the created folder \"dumux\".\nThe script does not modify your system or local environment.\n\n## 2. Manually installing DUNE and Dumux from source\n\n### 2.1 Obtaining the DUNE core modules\n\nDuMux depends on [Dune](https://dune-project.org/).\nRequired are the libraries/modules `dune-common`, `dune-geometry`,\n`dune-grid`, `dune-localfunctions`, and `dune-istl`.\nYou can obtain the required Dune modules in form of binary packages\nfor Debian, Ubuntu and openSUSE, see the [Dune binary packages](http://www.dune-project.org/binary/).\nThe Dune releases can also be obtained as [tarballs](https://www.dune-project.org/releases/).\nAlternatively and recommended and described below, you can use [git](https://www.dune-project.org/dev/downloadgit/)\nto download the source code and configure and build with the `dunecontrol` script.\nTo clone the Dune core modules, run:\n\n```bash\nfor module in common geometry grid localfunctions istl; do\n    git clone -b releases/2.10 https://gitlab.dune-project.org/core/dune-$module.git\ndone\n```\n\n### 2.2 Obtaining the Dumux source code\n\nTo clone the latest 3.10 release version, run\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b releases/3.10 https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux.git\n```\n\nThe master branch (developer version) can be cloned with\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux.git\n```\n\nAlternatively, it is also possible to download release tarballs\nfrom [DaRUS](https://doi.org/10.18419/darus-3788) or\nfrom [GitLab](https://git.iws.uni-stuttgart.de/dumux-repositories/dumux/-/releases).\n\n### 2.3 Configure and build\n\nAfter obtaining all modules (at least `dune-common`,`dune-geometry`,`dune-grid`,`dune-istl`,`dune-localfunctions` and `dumux`),\nDuMux is built together with other Dune modules. Assuming that the Dune core modules and DuMux are folders in the same directory\n\n    DUMUX (installation folder)\n    |- dune-common\n    |- dune-geometry\n    |- dune-grid\n    |- dune-istl\n    |- dune-localfunctions\n    |- dumux\n\nyou can configure and build the module stack with the `dunecontrol` helper script:\n\n```bash\n./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=dumux/cmake.opts all\n```\n\nIn case you have obtained the DUNE modules via a package manager,\n`dunecontrol` should be an available program in your path environment\n(replace `./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol` by `dunecontrol`).\n\nRunning `dunecontrol` will create a build folder called\n`build-cmake` in each of the module folders.\nIn case you want to build the module stack in a separate build folder use\n\n```bash\n./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=dumux/cmake.opts --builddir=$(pwd)/build all\n```\n\nMore details on the DUNE build system can be found in the [Dune installation notes](http://www.dune-project.org/doc/installation/).\n\n### Compiler options\n\nDune and DuMux rely heavily on compiler optimization.\nThe speed difference between running a compiler-optimized versus a non-optimized DuMux executable can easily exceed a factor of $10$.\nThe default `cmake.opts` in `dumux/cmake.opts` already enable compiler optimisations.\nTo use debug options use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` instead of `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` in the `cmake.opts`, or\nadd `set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Debug)` to any `CMakeLists.txt` containing a test that you want\nto compile non-optimised and with debug symbols enabled.\n\nIn case you are running macOS on a recent arm chip (M1, M2) your compiler might not support the flag `-march=native` yet.\nYou can replace this flag by a `mcpu=<cpu>` flag, where `<cpu>` is the best match of available option shown by\n`clang --print-supported-cpus`.\n\nOften it makes sense to create and keep around a custom option file for `dunecontrol` tailored\nto your local setup. You can use `dumux/cmake.opts` as a starting point.\n\n## 3. Install external dependencies via script\n\nThere are various external libraries and modules that provide additional functionality but are\nnot generally required to run DuMux.\nDuMux contains the script `installexternal.py` which allows you to install extension from your DuMux installation directory.\n\nIf you run the script with the option \\-\\-help\n\n```bash\npython3 dumux/bin/installexternal.py --help\n```\n\nit will show a list of installable packages. Dune modules can be installed by adding the name of the package.\nFor example, running the script by typing:\n\n```bash\npython3 dumux/bin/installexternal.py alugrid\n```\n\ndownloads the ALUGrid module `dune-alugrid` in a separate folder in your installation directory. After the download\nyou can run following command to clean the CMake cache:\n\n```bash\n./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol bexec rm -r CMakeFiles CMakeCache.txt\n```\n\nAfterwards you can reconfigure and build DuMux with the `dunecontrol` script:\n\n```bash\n./dune-common/bin/dunecontrol --opts=./dumux/cmake.opts all\n```\n\nIf you install an external library which is not a Dune module, the script will\ninstall the library in the directory `external`. If you install external libraries in an non-standard location you\nmust usually either set the root path of the package (e.g. `CGAL_ROOT=<path/to/folder>`) or add the path to the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`\nvariable. These variables can be added in the option file `cmake.opts` before running `dunecontrol`. Compiler definitions are\npassed to CMake with the `-D` prefix, e.g. `-DCGAL_ROOT=<path/to/folder>`, so variables passed via `cmake.opts` need `-D` at the beginning.\nAfter you have installed an external library you should also clean the CMake cache and\nreconfigure and build DuMux as mentioned above.\n\n\n## Compatible versions of Dune and DuMux\n\nOnly the following Dune and DuMux versions are compatible:\n\n| DuMux version     | Dune version              |\n|-------------------|---------------------------|\n| master            | 2.10, master              |\n| 3.10              | 2.10                      |\n| 3.7, 3.8,  3.9    | 2.9                       |\n| 3.5, 3.6          | 2.8, 2.9                  |\n| 3.3, 3.4          | 2.7, 2.8                  |\n| 3.1, 3.2          | 2.6<sup>*</sup>, 2.7      |\n| 3.0               | 2.6<sup>*</sup>, 2.7      |\n| 2.10, 2.11, 2.12  | 2.4, 2.5, 2.6<sup>*</sup> |\n\n<sup>*</sup> Use the most recent version of the git branch `releases/2.6` instead of the `2.6.0` tarballs.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dumux/dumux/master/doc/doxygen/pages/installation.md"}], "run": [{"result": {"value": "To find out how to build a test inspect the `CMakeLists.txt` file in the respective test folder.\n\nThe `dumux_add_test`\ncommand specifies some important parameters: `NAME` sets the name of the test.
