Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n### 2. Conveying Modified Versions\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n* **a)** under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\nensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\nfunction or data, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n* **b)** under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\nthis License applicable to that copy.\n\n### 3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.

A suitable mechanism is one that **(a)** uses at run time\na copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\nsystem, and **(b)** will operate properly with a modified version\nof the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\nVersion.\n\n* **e)** Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\nbe required to provide such information under section 6 of the\nGNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\nnecessary to install and execute a modified version of the\nCombined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\nApplication with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\nyou use option **4d0**, the Installation Information must accompany\nthe Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\nCode. If you use option **4d1**, you must provide the Installation\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\nfor conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n### 5. Combined Libraries\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n* **a)** Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\non the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\nconveyed under the terms of this License.\n* **b)** Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\nis a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n### 6.

If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public
