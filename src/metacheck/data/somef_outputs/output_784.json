Spaghetti plots show a selection of posterior draws of the population trajectories as many distinct lines. These lines provide a different way to summarise the uncertainty of the population trajectories that separates the uncertainty of the trends (shape of the population trajectory) from the uncertainty in the mean abundance (vertical placement on the graphs).\r\n\r\nadds options to estimate trends from any model using a gam-based smooth. The gam_smooths argument in the generate_indices(gam_smooths = TRUE) function creates an array of posterior draws of gam smooths through the population trajectory. These posterior draws can be used in the generate_trends(gam = TRUE) function to estimate trends and their uncertainties based on these smooths, for any custom range of dates. These smooth trends provide an alternative to the end-point trends that are the default in bbsBayes2. If the gam argument is set to TRUE, all of the trend and population change calculations are based on the posterior array of smooths, rather than the posterior array of annual indices. Calculating the smooths in generate_indices requires significantly more time and so the gam_smooths option is set to FALSE by default.\r\n\r\nadds informative error messages to: a) identify challenges with interpreting the observed annual means relative to estimate trajectories for composite regions (all except stratum); b) identify species and time-periods where analyses may be complicated by changes in species taxonomy (see bbsBayes2::species_notes); and c) identify when the strata_custom optional sf object passed to stratify does not have the correct crs and strata_name column type.\r\n\r\nprepare_data now exports columns including latitude and longitude of each BBS route start-location in the raw_data component of the output list.\r\n\r\nfix a number of errors and issues identified in version 1.1.1.\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2/compare/v1.1.1...v1.1.2", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2/tarball/v1.1.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2/zipball/v1.1.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2/releases/tag/v1.1.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2/releases/178455952", "release_id": 178455952, "date_created": "2024-10-04T17:31:48Z", "date_published": "2024-10-04T17:35:45Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/bbsBayes/bbsBayes2/releases/119502213", "tag": "v1.1.1", "name": "1.1.1", "author": {"name": "AdamCSmithCWS", "type": "User"}, "description": "Releases 1.1.0 represents an update to the package from 1.0.0 to access the most recent release of BBS database (2023 - including field observations from 1966 - 2022).\r\n1.1.1 represents a patch to correct some failing checks and tests in 1.1.0\r\n\r\nIn addition, there have been some fixes and additional capacity that relate to the following issues:\r\n#10  adds some code to the first_difference, spatial model to force 0 spatial variance in 2020 - the year when the BBS was cancelled and so there are no data and therefore no information with which to meaningfully estimate the variance in annual differences among strata.\r\n#50 allows the `plot_map()` function to plot any of the numerical values in the output from `generate_trends()`. e.g., to display trend uncertainty by plotting the credible limits or width of the credible intervals of the trend estimates, or to display the mean relative abundance among strata during the trend period.
