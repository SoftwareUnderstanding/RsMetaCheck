However, these are usually not in a format readily available for use in programs that can understand and manipulate trees. For example, the global taxonomy of languages published by the [Ethnologue](https://www.ethnologue.com/) classifies languages into families and subgroups using a taxonomy string e.g. the language [Kalam](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kmh) is classified as \"Trans-New Guinea, Madang, Kalam-Kobon\", while [Mauwake](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/mhl) is classified as \"Trans-New Guinea, Madang, Croisilles, Pihom\", and [Kare](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/kmf) is \"Trans-New Guinea, Madang, Croisilles, Kare\". This classification indicates that while all these languages are part of the Madang subgroup of the Trans-New Guinea language family, Kare and Mauwake are more closely related (as they belong to the Croisilles subgroup). \nBoth the taxonomy string and tabular format however are hard to load into software packages that can analyse, compare, visualise and manipulate trees. ```treemaker``` aims to make this easy by converting taxonomic data into [Newick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newick_format) and Nexus (Maddison 1997) formats commonly used by phylogenetic manipulation programs.\n \n",
