In Source Extractor, background\nestimation, object detection and photometry are deeply integrated into the\nSource Extractor executable. Many changes to the code were necessary in\norder to put the functionality in stand-alone C functions. It's too much\nto ask of the Source Extractor developer to rewrite large parts of the\ncore of the Source Extractor program with little gain for the executable.\n\n**What sort of changes?**\n\n- Source Extractor reads in only a small portion of each image at a\n  time.  This allows it to keep its memory footprint extremely low and\n  to operate on images that are much larger than the system's physical\n  memory. It also means that a FITS reader is deeply integrated into\n  the code.  SEP operates on images in memory, so all the FITS I/O\n  machinery in Source Extractor is not used here.\n\n- Error handling: When it encounters a problem, Source Extractor\n  immediately exits with an error message. This is fine for an\n  executable, but a library function doesn't have that luxury. Instead\n  it must ensure that allocated memory is freed and return an error\n  code.\n\n- Options: Source Extractor has many options that affect its behavior. These\n  are stored in a global structure used throughout the executable. In SEP,\n  options for a particular function are passed as function parameters.\n\n- Array types: Source Extractor can operate on FITS images containing various\n  types of data (float, double, int, etc). Internally, it does this by\n  converting all data to `float` immediately when reading from disk.\n  SEP does something similar, but in memory: SEP functions typically convert\n  input arrays to float on the fly within each function, then perform\n  all operations as floating point.\n\n**Is SEP as fast as Source Extractor?**\n\nIt's fast. It should be similar to Source Extractor as a lot of the code\nis identical. Source Extractor has the advantage of doing all the\noperations (detection and analysis) simultaneously on each image\nsection, which may confer CPU cache advantages, but this hasn't been\ntested at all. On the other hand, depending on your usage SEP might\nlet you avoid writing files to disk, which is likely to be a bigger\nwin.\n\n**What happens when Source Extractor is updated in the future?**\n\nSEP can be considered a fork of the Source Extractor code base: it's\ndevelopment will not track that of Source Extractor in any automated\nway. However, the algorithms implemented so far in SEP are stable in\nSource Extractor: the SEP code was forked from v2.18.11, yet it is tested\nagainst the results of v2.8.6. This indicates that the algorithms have\nnot changed in Source Extractor over the last few years.\n\n**In the Python interface, why do I have to byte swap data when using\nastropy.io.fits?**\n\nThis occurs because FITS files have big-endian [byte\norder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness), whereas most widely\nused CPUs have little-endian byte order. In order for the CPU to\noperate on the data, it must be byte swapped at *some point.* Some\nFITS readers such as [fitsio](http://github.com/esheldon/fitsio) do\nthe byte swap immediately when reading the data from disk to memory,\nreturning numpy arrays in native (little-endian) byte order. However,\nastropy.io.fits does not (for reasons having to do with memory\nmapping). Most of the time you never notice this because when you do\nany numpy operations on such arrays, numpy uses an intermediate buffer\nto byte swap the array behind the scenes and returns the result as a\nnative byte order array. Internally, SEP is not using numpy\noperations; it's just getting a pointer to the data in the array and\npassing it to C code. As the C code does not include functionality to\ndo buffered byte swapping, the input array must already be in native\nbyte order.\n\nIt would be possible to add buffered byte swapping capability to the\nSEP code, but it would increase the code complexity. A simpler\nalternative would be to make a byte swapped copy of the entire input\narray, whenever necessary. However, this would significantly increase\nmemory use, and would have to be done repeatedly in multiple SEP\nfunctions: `Background`, `extract`, `sum_circle`, etc. Each would make\na copy of the entire data array. Given these considerations, it seemed\nbest to just explicitly tell the user to do the byte swap operation\nthemselves so they could just do it once, immediately after reading in\nthe data.\n\n**I have more questions!**\n\nOpen a discussion on the [GitHub Discussions page](https://github.com/sep-developers/sep/discussions/categories/q-a)!", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "FAQ", "parent_header": ["SEP"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "SEP"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}], "related_documentation": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://sep-pjw.readthedocs.io/", "format": "readthedocs"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}], "package_distribution": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://pypi.org/project/sep/"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://pypi.org/project/sep)/"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}], "images": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00058/status.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "http://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00058/status.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sep-developers/sep/main/README.md"}]}
