If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"pharmaverse/ggsurvfit\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n*  Pull request should include unit testing of the new feature or bug fix.\n    * Unit tests will typically include testing using the testthat package, and testing of images (i.e. ggplots) using the vdiffr package.\n    * To test the structure of a ggplot object, you have want to first build the plot using `ggplot2::ggplot_build()`. Then you can programitcally test the contents of the plot.\n    \n*   Errors, warnings, and messages are created with `cli::cli_abort()`, `cli::cli_warn()`, `cli::cli_inform()`. We use the convention to first print the error message, then a helpful message when it applies. For example, \n\n      ```r\n      cli::cli_abort(c(\"!\" = \"There was an error.\",\n                       \"i\" = \"a helpful message to resolve error\"))\n      ```\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the ggsurvfit project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
