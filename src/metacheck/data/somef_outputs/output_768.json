Conversions;\n```\n\n- Specify codemeta.json path:\n\n```php\n> $codeMetaPath = 'CodeMeta/codeMeta.json'\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> By default, codemeta.json is located under 'CodeMeta' directory where an example already exists.\n> `$codeMetaPath` can _also_ directly take codemeta.json as an array\n\n- Specify target scheme (as fully qualified class name)\n\n```php\n> $dataCite = \\Schemes\\DataCite::class\n> $bibLatex = \\Schemes\\BibLatex::class\n> $bibTex   = \\Schemes\\BibTex::class\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> By default, scheme classes are located under 'Schemes' directory.\n\n- Get the conversion from the specified Codemeta.json:\n\n```php\n> $errors = NULL;    // initialise errors variable\n \n> $dataCiteFromCodeMeta = CodeMetaConversion::To($dataCite, $codeMetaPath, $errors)      // array-formatted\n\n> $bibLatexFromCodeMeta = CodeMetaConversion::To($bibLatex, $codeMetaPath, $errors)      // string-formatted\n\n> $bibTexFromCodeMeta = CodeMetaConversion::To($bibTex, $codeMetaPath, $errors)          // string-formatted\n```\n\n- Retrieve errors (if occurred) from the `Illuminate\\Support\\MessageBag()` instance:\n\n```php\n> $errors->messages()      // gets error messages as specified in CodeMeta/conversionsValidations.php\n\n> $errors->keys()          // gets codemeta keys where errors occurred\n\n> $errors->first()         // gets the first occurred error message\n\n> $errors->has('identifier')    // checks whether an error has occurred in the codemeta `identifier` key\n```\n\n> [!Note]\n> Validations use the `Illuminate\\Validation\\Validator` package.\n> Error messages and rules can be customised in `CodeMeta/conversionsValidations.php` as per the package syntax.\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt",
