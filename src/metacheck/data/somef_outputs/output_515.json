Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3.

Another scintillator could be inserted at S8 to study the FRS transmission.\nEach scintillator is read out by two PMTs: right and left.\nAt S2, the scintillator gives the position of the beam and make the start of the time of flight of the beam.\nAt cave C, the scintillator make the stop of the beam, and the start for the times of flight of the fission fragments.\n\n- Common reference signal (SofComRef)\nDeux independent DAQ are running at S2 and cave C.\nThe clock of the VFTX-TDC are not synchronised.\nTo calculate the ToF from S2 to Cave C, one common signal is sent to each cave.\n\n- Time-of-flight wall (SofToFW)\nmade with 28 vertical scintillators. \nEach scintillator are readout by 2 PMTs : down and up.\nIn order to follow the coordinate system, plastic 1 is on the right and plastic 28 is on the left, looking in the same direction than the beam.\n\n- Triple-MUSIC (SofTriM)\nSofTriM has 3 sections along the beam direction (z axis).\nEach section has 6 anodes (3 pairs of trapezoidal anodes) which are readout in energy and time.\nEnergy losses obtained from each section are independent.\nWe need to combine them to get rid, as much as possible, of the charge states of the secondary beam.\n\n- Twin-MUSIC\nSofTwiM is a double detector with a common central cathod.\nThere are 2 anodes planes (plane 1: right plane, plane 2: left plane).\nEach anode plane is vertically segmented (section 1: lower section, section 2: upper section), \nand has 16 anodes along the beam axis.\nThis defines 4 different detection volumes.\nWith this geometry, we can simultaneously measure both fission fragments in coincidence, as long as each fragment are going through the SofTwiM in two different detection volumes\n\n- MWPC\nThere are 3 types of MWMPCs. \nThe first type (MWPC0) is coupled to SofTriM, to get the (x,y) position of the beam. In x, there are 64 vertical pads and in y, 64 horizontal pads.\nThe second type is located before and after the SofTwiM detector to get the (x,y) position of each fission fragment before the magnet. This second kind of MWPC is vertically segmented into two sections. Therefore, in x, there are 64 down pads and 64 up pads, and in y, there are 40 vertically pads.\nThe third type is located after the magnet and just before the SofToFW. In x, there are 288 vertical pads and in y, 120 horizontal pads.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Some Details of the SOFIA Setup", "parent_header": ["SOFIA Software <a href=\"COPYRIGHT\"><img alt=\"license\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg\" /></a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14290959\"><img alt=\"DOI\" src=\"https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14290959.svg\" /></a>", "Spell Checking"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/blob/dev/README.md"}], "contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "Please ask your questions, request features, and report issues by [creating a github issue](https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/issues/new).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contributing", "parent_header": ["SOFIA Software <a href=\"COPYRIGHT\"><img alt=\"license\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg\" /></a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14290959\"><img alt=\"DOI\" src=\"https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14290959.svg\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/blob/dev/README.md"}], "identifier": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14290959"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/blob/dev/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "SOFIA Software"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/blob/dev/README.md"}], "images": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/dev//input/p2p_r3bsetup.jpg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/sofia/blob/dev/README.md"}]}
