The third of the following steps\ndescribes how to link your package with `srr` in order to use these\nroclets. \n1.  Ensure that your package successfully passes all\n    [`autotest`](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/autotest)\n    tests, potentially including setting `test = FALSE` flags to switch\n    off any tests you consider not to be applicable to your package. For\n    details, please see the [package documentation for\n    `autotest`](https://docs.ropensci.org/autotest/). \n2.  Decide which of our in-scope categories of statistical software best\n    describe your package. The function\n    [`srr_stats_categories()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_categories.html)\n    provides a list of currently developed categories for which\n    standards have been developed, along with links to the online\n    standards for each category: \n    That function also returns links to the full descriptions of each\n    category in the [main project\n    book](https://stats-devguide.ropensci.org/standards.html). Any\n    software within one or more of these categories may be considered\n    for review. \n3.  Enable your package to use the `srr_stats` roclets by modifying the\n    package\u2019s `DESCRIPTION` file so that the `Roxygen` line looks like\n    this: \n    That will load the [\u201croclet\u201d](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) used by\n    this package to process the documentation of statistical standards\n    within your actual code. Note that you do not need to add, import,\n    or depend upon the `srr` package anywhere else within the\n    `DESCRIPTION` file or your actual package. \n        ## [1] \"#' srr_stats\"                                                                 \n        ## [2] \"#'\"                                                                           \n        ## [3] \"#' All of the following standards initially have `@srrstatsTODO` tags.\"       \n        ## [4] \"#' These may be moved at any time to any other locations in your code.\"       \n        ## [5] \"#' Once addressed, please modify the tag from `@srrstatsTODO` to `@srrstats`,\"\n        ## [6] \"#' or `@srrstatsNA`, ensuring that references to every one of the following\" \n    The file will contain a list of all standards from your nominated\n    categories. This file may be renamed, and the individual items moved\n    to other locations in other files, but all nominated standards\n    should remain in [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) blocks\n    somewhere in your source code. \n    The `@srrstatsVerbose` line defines a variable which may be used to\n    suppress output from the `srrstats` roclet when updating package\n    documentation (by setting to `FALSE`). After that comes the list of\n    standards, each of which is prefixed by a\n    [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) tag, `@srrstatsTODO`. A\n    package can only be submitted once all of these `TODO` items have\n    been addressed via one of the options described in the following two\n    items. \n5.  A standard may be addressed by moving the item in the\n    `srr-stats-standards.R` file (or wherever you\u2019ve chosen to list\n    these within your own package) to one or more places in your code\n    where these standards have been addressed. In doing so, the\n    [`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org) tag should be changed from\n    `@srrstatsTODO` to `@srrstats`, and the text which initially lists\n    the actual standard should be changed to provide a brief description\n    of how that standard has been met. Tags for one particular standard\n    may be repeated in multiple places within your code, and we\n    encourage locating multiple `@srrstats` tags which refer to a\n    particular standard at all locations which directly address that\n    standard. \n6.  Alternatively, any standards which you consider not applicable to\n    your software may remain listed in the templated section of the main\n    `srr-stats-standards.R` document (or any alternative location), with\n    their tag changed from `@srrstatsTODO` to `@srrstatsNA`, and the\n    description of the standard removed and replaced by an explanation\n    of why you consider that standard not to be applicable to your\n    software. These `@srrstatsNA` tags should be collected together\n    within a single `roxygen2` block with a title of `NA_standards`, as\n    provided in the initial template generated by the\n    [`srr_stats_roxygen()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/reference/srr_stats_roxygen.html)\n    function. Any non-applicable standards can then just be moved into\n    this block, with their `@srrstatsTODO` tags changed to `@srrstatsNA` \nNote that the skeleton package also includes C++ code in a `src/`\ndirectory, so will be compiled the first time your run\n[`roxygensise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html).\nRunning a second time will generate cleaner output from the `srr_stats`\nroclets only. The tags included in\n[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) blocks in this skeleton\npackage may be modified, moved, copied, and changed in any way you like\nto help you understand how the roclets work. Simply play around with the\n[`roxygen2`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/) lines and run\n[`roxygensise()`](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/reference/roxygenize.html)\neach time to see the effect. Individual standards may be moved to, and\naddressed in, any location including the directories `R/`, `src/`, or\n`tests/`, and well as in `.Rmd` documentation files such as `README.Rmd`\nor package vignettes. The `srr_stats` roclet associated with this\npackage is able to parse the various `@srrstats` tags in all of these\nlocations.\n \n", "original_header": "For Package Developers"}, "confidence": 0.8825776837787264, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "While the `srr` package enables standards compliance to be documented\nthrough inserting `@srrstats` tags in as many locations as possible, in\norder to ensure compliance is documented as close as possible to the\npoint within the code where each standard is addressed, it is not\npossible to insert `roxygen2` tags in every type of file.

Let others discover it, by telling them in person,\nvia Twitter or a blog post.\n\nUsing `srr` for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing\nit](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/blob/main/inst/CITATION).\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing `srr` and got stuck? [Browse the\ndocumentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/) to see if you can find a\nsolution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/issues). While we\ncannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions\noften lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by\n[email](mailto:mark@ropensci.org).\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new `srr` feature? Take a look at [the\ndocumentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/) and [issues\nlist](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/issues) to see if it\nisn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/issues/new).\nWhile we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing `srr` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have\nthe same experience and report it as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/issues/new) so we can\nfix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please:\n\n- Use [the `reprex` package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) to create a\n  reproducible example.\n- Include the version of `srr` with the following line in your `reprex`\n  code:\n  ```\n  packageVersion(\"srr\")\n  ```\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example?\nGood documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very\nwelcome!\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website](https://docs.ropensci.org/srr/) is generated with\n[`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any\nhtml: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes,\n[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the\npackage `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around\n`pkgdown`, you can [propose a file\nchange](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)\nto improve documentation. If not, [report an\nissue](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/issues/new) and we can\npoint you in the right direction.\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to\ndocumentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you\nwant to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code\n   repository](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/tree/main/R).\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file\n   change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)\n   to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with\n   `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `srr`? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f\nHave a look at the [issue\nlist](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/srr/issues) and leave a\ncomment on the things you want to work on.

Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull\n   request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n\n## Code style\n\nThe `srr` coding style diverges somewhat from [the commonly used tidyverse\nstyle guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing), primarily\nthrough judicious use of\nwhitespace, which aims to improve code readability. Code references in\n`srr` are separated by whitespace, just like words of text. Just like it\nis easier to understand \"these three words\" than \"thesethreewords\", code is \nformatted like this:\n\n``` r\nthese <- three (words (x))\n```\n\nand not like this:\n\n``` r\nthese <- three(words(x))\n```\n\nThe position of brackets is then arbitrary, and we could also write\n\n``` r\nthese <- three( words (x))\n```\n\n`srr` code opts for the former style, with the natural result that one\nends up writing\n\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n```\n\nwith a space between `function` and `()`. You can easily (re-)format your code\nto accord with this style [by installing the `spaceout`\npackage](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/spaceout) and running:\n\n```r\nstyler::style_pkg (style = spaceout::spaceout_style)\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":
