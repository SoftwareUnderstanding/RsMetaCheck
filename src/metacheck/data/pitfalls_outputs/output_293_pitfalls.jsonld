  "description": "Decorate functions to make them return enhanced output. The\n    enhanced output consists in an object of type 'chronicle' containing\n    the result of the function applied to its arguments, as well as a log\n    detailing when the function was run, what were its inputs, what were\n    the errors (if the function failed to run) and other useful\n    information. Tools to handle decorated functions are included, such as\n    a forward pipe operator that makes chaining decorated functions\n    possible.",
