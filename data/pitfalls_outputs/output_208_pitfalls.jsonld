  "description": "Multi-block data analysis concerns the analysis of several\n    sets of variables (blocks) observed on the same group of individuals.\n    The main aims of the RGCCA package are: to study the relationships\n    between blocks and to identify subsets of variables of each block\n    which are active in their relationships with the other blocks. This\n    package allows to (i) run R/SGCCA and related methods,\n    (ii) help the user to find out the optimal parameters for R/SGCCA such\n    as regularization parameters (tau or sparsity), (iii) evaluate the\n    stability of the RGCCA results and their significance, (iv) build predictive\n    models from the R/SGCCA. (v) Generic print()\n    and plot() functions apply to all these functionalities.",
