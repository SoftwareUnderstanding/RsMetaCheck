With this newfound wealth of data, a need has arisen for high-efficiency bioinformatics pipelines and tools that allow for the analysis of scRNA-seq data. One computational method currently in use is **differential gene expression (DGE) analysis**, which identifies statistically significant genes (i.e., results that are minimally confounded by experimental errors) and determines the expression level of a gene relative to the entire dataset.<sup>2</sup> Using these statistically significant results, it is possible to correlate the most highly expressed genes to their tangible, biological effects through the use of **gene ontology** databases such as the [Gene Ontology Knowledgebase (GO)](https://www.geneontology.org/).\n<br></br>\nThe SPARC Portal currently hosts a rich collection of scRNA-seq data across several different tissues and species.

o\u00b2S\u00b2PARC. Using sPARcRNA_Viz,\n  researchers can create an interactive t-SNE from\n  single-cell RNA-sequencing data, as well as perform in\n  silico GSEA analysis to determine the most highly\n  expressed genes. From these statistically significant\n  genes, researchers can determine potential gene ontologies\n  arising from their sample(s). In addition, the seamless\n  integration of sPARcRNA_Viz with the o\u00b2S\u00b2PARC computing\n  platform enables data accessibility concordant with FAIR\n  Data Principles.\nkeywords:\n  - single cell RNA\n  - differential gene expression analysis\n  - tSNE\n  - GSEA\nlicense: MIT\nversion: 1.0.0\ndate-released: '2024-08-12'\ndoi: 10.5281/zenodo.13308297\n", "type": "File_dump", "author": [{"type": "Agent", "name": "Mahitha Simhambhatla", "family_name": "Simhambhatla", "given_name": "Mahitha", "url": "https://orcid.org/0009-0004-1527-5864"}, {"type": "Agent", "name": "Raina Patel", "family_name": "Patel", "given_name": "Raina", "url": "https://orcid.org/0009-0000-5129-4334"}, {"type": "Agent", "name": "Mihir Samdarshi", "family_name": "Samdarshi", "given_name": "Mihir", "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2316-453X"}, {"type": "Agent", "name": "Ayla Bratton", "family_name": "Bratton", "given_name": "Ayla", "url": "https://orcid.org/0009-0004-4518-8593"}, {"type": "Agent", "name": "Sanjay Soundarajan", "family_name": "Soundarajan", "given_name": "Sanjay", "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2829-8032"}, {"type": "Agent", "name": "Vardaan Bhat", "family_name": "Bhat", "given_name": "Vardaan"}], "title": "sPARcRNA_Viz", "url": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13308297", "doi": "10.5281/zenodo.13308297", "format": "cff", "datePublished": "2024"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/sPARcRNA_Viz/main/CITATION.cff"}, {"result": {"value": "Samdarshi, M., Soundarajan, S., Simhambhatla, M., Patel, R.
