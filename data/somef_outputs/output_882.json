responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of\nacceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,\nor harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\ncomments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\nnot aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation\ndecisions when appropriate.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when\nan individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.\nExamples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,\nposting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at\nai4eosc-support@listas.csic.es.\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\nreporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining\nthe consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series\nof actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or\npermanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within\nthe community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0, available at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
