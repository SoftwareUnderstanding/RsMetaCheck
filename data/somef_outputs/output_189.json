Data for each package are separated by a comma, while\ndata within each package are separated by a colon.\n``` r\ns$external_calls\n```\n \nThis structure allows numbers of calls to all packages to be readily\nextracted with code like the following:\n``` r\ncalls <- do.call (\n    rbind,\n    strsplit (strsplit (s$external_call, \",\") [[1]], \":\")\n)\ncalls <- data.frame (\n    package = calls [, 1],\n    n_total = as.integer (calls [, 2]),\n    n_unique = as.integer (calls [, 3])\n)\nprint (calls)\n```\n \nFinally, the summary statistics conclude with two further statistics of\n`afferent_pkg` and `efferent_pkg`. These are package-internal measures\nof [afferent and efferent\ncouplings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_package_metrics)\nbetween the files of a package. The *afferent* couplings (`ca`) are\nnumbers of *incoming* calls to each file of a package from functions\ndefined elsewhere in the package, while the *efferent* couplings (`ce`)\nare numbers of *outgoing* calls from each file of a package to functions\ndefined elsewhere in the package. These can be used to derive a measure\nof \u201cinternal package instability\u201d as the ratio of efferent to total\ncoupling (`ce / (ce + ca)`). \n", "original_header": "Overview of statistics and the `pkgstats_summary()` function"}, "confidence": 0.9352959884601335, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "Please note that this package is released with a [Contributor Code of\nConduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).

By contributing to this\nproject, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know\nmore about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see\nthis [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).\n\n### Share the love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThink `pkgstats` is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person,\nvia Twitter or a blog post.\n\nUsing `pkgstats` for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing\nit](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/blob/main/inst/CITATION).\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing `pkgstats` and got stuck? [Browse the\ndocumentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/) to see if you can find a\nsolution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/issues). While we\ncannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions\noften lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by\n[email](mailto:mark@ropensci.org).\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new `pkgstats` feature? Take a look at [the\ndocumentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/) and [issues\nlist](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/issues) to see if it\nisn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/issues/new).\nWhile we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing `pkgstats` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have\nthe same experience and report it as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/issues/new) so we can\nfix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please:\n\n- Use [the `reprex` package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) to create a\n  reproducible example.\n- Include the version of `pkgstats` with the following line in your `reprex`\n  code:\n  ```\n  packageVersion(\"pkgstats\")\n  ```\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example?\nGood documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very\nwelcome!\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgstats/) is generated with\n[`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any\nhtml: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes,\n[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the\npackage `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around\n`pkgdown`, you can [propose a file\nchange](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)\nto improve documentation. If not, [report an\nissue](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/issues/new) and we can\npoint you in the right direction.\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to\ndocumentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you\nwant to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code\n   repository](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/tree/main/R).\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file\n   change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)\n   to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with\n   `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `pkgstats`? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f\nHave a look at the [issue\nlist](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/issues) and leave a\ncomment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines\nbelow.\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub\nflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/) and\n   clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this\n   guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while\n   since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original\n   repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/)\n   to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull\n   request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n\n## Code style\n\nThe `pkgstats` coding style diverges somewhat from [the commonly used tidyverse\nstyle guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing), primarily\nthrough judicious use of\nwhitespace, which aims to improve code readability. Code references in\n`pkgstats` are separated by whitespace, just like words of text. Just like it\nis easier to understand \"these three words\" than \"thesethreewords\", code is \nformatted like this:\n\n``` r\nthese <- three (words (x))\n```\n\nand not like this:\n\n``` r\nthese <- three(words(x))\n```\n\nThe position of brackets is then arbitrary, and we could also write\n\n``` r\nthese <- three( words (x))\n```\n\n`pkgstats` code opts for the former style, with the natural result that one\nends up writing\n\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n```\n\nwith a space between `function` and `()`. You can easily (re-)format your code\nto accord with this style [by installing the `spaceout`\npackage](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/spaceout) and running:\n\n```r\nstyler::style_pkg (style = spaceout::spaceout_style)\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_build_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "format": "description"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "pkgstats", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "version": [{"result": {"value": "0.2.0.075", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "0.2.0.075", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/codemeta.json"}], "authors": [{"result": {"value": [{"value": "Mark Padgham", "email": "mark.padgham@email.com"}], "type": "Agent", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "Mark Padgham", "type": "String", "email": "mark.padgham@email.com", "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2172-5265"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/codemeta.json"}], "license": [{"result": {"value": "GPL-3", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0", "type": "License", "identifier": "https://spdx.org/licenses/https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0", "spdx_id": "https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/codemeta.json"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": ["https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/actions?query=workflow%3AR-CMD-check", "https://app.codecov.io/gh/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats"], "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/codemeta.json"}], "development_status": [{"result": {"value": "https://www.repostatus.org/#active", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/codemeta.json"}], "identifier": [{"result": {"value": "pkgstats", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/codemeta.json"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "---\ntitle: \"Installation\"\nauthor: \n  - \"Mark Padgham\"\ndate: \"`r Sys.Date()`\"\nvignette: >\n  %\\VignetteIndexEntry{Installation}\n  %\\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}\n  %\\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}\n---\n\n```{r setup, include=FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set (\n    collapse = TRUE,\n    warning = TRUE,\n    message = TRUE,\n    width = 120,\n    comment = \"#>\",\n    fig.retina = 2,\n    fig.path = \"README-\"\n)\noptions (repos = c (\n    ropenscireviewtools = \"https://ropensci-review-tools.r-universe.dev\",\n    CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"\n))\n```\n\nThe `pkgstats` package [is on\nCRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pkgstats), so can be installed\ndirectly with,\n\n```{r install, eval = FALSE}\ninstall.packages (\"pkgstats\")\n```\n\nThe latest development version can be installed [via the associated\n`r-universe`](https://ropensci-review-tools.r-universe.dev/pkgstats). As\nshown there, simply enable the universe with\n\n```{r options, eval = FALSE}\noptions (repos = c (\n    ropenscireviewtools = \"https://ropensci-review-tools.r-universe.dev\",\n    CRAN = \"https://cloud.r-project.org\"\n))\n```\n\nAnd then call `install.packages()` the same way. Alternatively, the development\nversion of the package can be installed by running one of the following lines:\n\n\n```{r remotes, eval = FALSE}\nremotes::install_github (\"ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats\")\npak::pkg_install (\"ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats\")\n```\n\nThe package can then loaded for use with:\n\n```{r library, eval = TRUE}\nlibrary (pkgstats)\n```\n\n## Installation on Linux systems\n\nThis package requires the [system libraries\n`ctags-universal`](https://ctags.io) and [GNU\n`global`](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/), both of which are\nautomatically installed along with the package on both Windows and MacOS\nsystems. Most Linux distributions do not include a sufficiently up-to-date\nversion of [`ctags-universal`](https://ctags.io), and so it must be compiled\nfrom source. This can be done by running a single function, `ctags_install()`,\nwhich will install both [`ctags-universal`](https://ctags.io) and [GNU\n`global`](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/).\n\nThe `pkgstats` package includes a function to ensure your local installations\nof `universal-ctags` and `global` work correctly. Please ensure you see the\nfollowing prior to proceeding:\n\n```{r ctags-check, eval = FALSE}\nctags_test ()\n#> [1] TRUE\n```\n\nNote that GNU `global` can be linked at installation to the Universal Ctags\nplug-in parser to expand the [default 5 languages to\n30](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/). This makes no difference to\n`pkgstats` results, as `gtags` output is only used to trace function call\nnetworks, which is only possible for compiled languages able to dynamically\nshare pointers to the same objects. This is possible with the default parser\nregardless. The wealth of extra information obtained from linking `global` to\nthe Universal Ctags parser is ultimately discarded anyway, yet parsing may take\nconsiderably longer. If this is the case, \"default\" behaviour may be recovered\nby first running the following command:\n\n```{r unsetenv, eval = FALSE}\nSys.unsetenv (c (\"GTAGSCONF\", \"GTAGSLABEL\"))\n```\n\n# Installation on macOS systems\n\nOn macOS, [GNU `global` and `universal-ctags`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/global) can be easily installed with Homebrew. First follow the instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/) to install Homebrew if you don't have it already. Then run the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nbrew install global\n```\n\nThis will install both `global` and a compatible version of `universal-ctags`.\n\n::: callout-note\nDo not install `ctags` via Homebrew with `brew install ctags` as the installed version will conflict with `global`'s required `universal-ctags` dependency. If you have `ctags` already installed for another purpose, see Homebrew's messages in the console on how to proceed after attempting to intall `global`, it will usually involve unlinking the existing `ctags` with `brew unlink ctags` or removing it completely with `brew rm ctags`.\n:::\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-review-tools/pkgstats/main/vignettes/installation.Rmd"}], "contributors": [{"result": {"value": "\n\n\n\n\n\nAll contributions to this project are gratefully acknowledged using the [`allcontributors` package](https://github.com/ropensci/allcontributors) following the [allcontributors](https://allcontributors.org) specification.
