Please \r\n  update any code using the old name; it will be removed in a future release.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* `get_stac_data()` gains an argument, `download_function`, which takes a \r\n  `STACItemCollection` object and returns a data frame, where columns correspond\r\n  to distinct assets, rows correspond to distinct items, and cells contain file\r\n  paths to the downloaded data.\r\n\r\n* `rsi_download_rasters()` is a new function that exposes how `get_stac_data()`\r\n  downloads assets. \r\n\r\n* `get_alos_palsar_imagery()` and `alos_palsar_mask_function()` are new \r\n  functions to help you get and mask ALOS PALSAR imagery, respectively. Thanks \r\n  to @h-a-graham via #48 and #50.\r\n\r\n* `get_naip_data()` is a function for getting National Agricultural Imagery\r\n  Program data from (by default) Planetary Computer. Data covers the continental\r\n  United States.\r\n  \r\n* `landsat_mask_function()` gains an argument, `include`, which lets you specify\r\n  whether you'd like to include pixels that represent land (`\"land\"`), water\r\n  (`\"water\"`), or both (`\"both\"`). Thanks to @mateuszrydzik for the report via\r\n  #37 (#46).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes and other changes\r\n\r\n* Progress bars have been split into separate bars for downloading, masking, \r\n  compositing and so on. \r\n  \r\n* `get_stac_data()` no longer errors in (rare) circumstances where calculating \r\n  the intersection of bounding boxes between your AOI and an individual item, \r\n  performed when setting `composite_function = NULL`, produces a bounding box\r\n  with `ymin` or `xmin` higher than `ymax` or `xmax`.\r\n\r\n* Functions will no longer error if you construct their arguments with \r\n  `glue::glue()` (or otherwise if they have more than one class).\r\n\r\n* `stack_rasters()` will only rename bands if `band_names` is the same length as \r\n  the number of bands in the output raster (or missing, or defined by a \r\n  function). It will now warn you if these lengths are different. Previously, if \r\n  you provided more than the required number of band names, `stack_rasters()` \r\n  would silently ignore the extra names, and would error if you provided fewer \r\n  names than bands. \r\n  \r\n* `get_stac_data()` now warns if `asset_names` is `NULL` and there is more \r\n  than one asset per item.\r\n  \r\n* Functions sending HTTP requests now set a user agent of \r\n  `rsi (https://permian-global-research.github.io/rsi/)`\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/tarball/v0.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/zipball/v0.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/releases/tag/v0.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/releases/149768347", "release_id": 149768347, "date_created": "2024-03-29T14:06:21Z", "date_published": "2024-04-04T13:03:54Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/releases/141863250", "tag": "v0.1.2", "name": "rsi 0.1.2", "author": {"name": "mikemahoney218", "type": "User"}, "description": "* `get_stac_data()` no longer includes `mask_band` in its outputs when \n  `composite_function = NULL`.

rsi\n\nThis document outlines how to propose a change to rsi.\n\n## Fixing typos\n\nYou can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. \nThis generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. \nYou can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n## Bigger changes\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s needed. \nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).\nSee our guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"Permian-Global-Research/rsi\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the rsi project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

After\nthat, `spectral_indices()` will only download a new file if the cache is\nolder than 1 day, or if the `update_cache` argument is `TRUE`, in order\nto provide the most up-to-date data as quickly as possible. If offline,\n`spectral_indices()` will always fall back to the cache or, if no cache\nfile exists, a (possibly out-of-date) data file included in rsi itself.\n\nSeparately, the `get_stac_data()` function provides a generic interface\nfor downloading composite images from any accessible STAC catalog. For\ninstance, we could download a cloud-masked composite of Landsat\u2019s\nvisible layers using `get_stac_data()` and a few helper functions from\nrsi:\n\n``` r\naoi <- sf::st_point(c(-74.912131, 44.080410))\naoi <- sf::st_set_crs(sf::st_sfc(aoi), 4326)\naoi <- sf::st_buffer(sf::st_transform(aoi, 5070), 1000)\n\nlandsat_image <- get_stac_data(\n  aoi,\n  start_date = \"2022-06-01\",\n  end_date = \"2022-06-30\",\n  pixel_x_size = 30,\n  pixel_y_size = 30,\n  asset_names = c(\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"),\n  stac_source = \"https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/api/stac/v1/\",\n  collection = \"landsat-c2-l2\",\n  mask_band = \"qa_pixel\",\n  mask_function = landsat_mask_function,\n  output_filename = tempfile(fileext = \".tif\"),\n  item_filter_function = landsat_platform_filter,\n  platforms = c(\"landsat-9\", \"landsat-8\")\n)\n\nterra::plot(terra::rast(landsat_image))\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nFor common data sets, rsi also provides helper functions which provide\nmost of these arguments for you. For instance, that `get_stac_data()`\ncall could be as simple as:\n\n``` r\nlandsat_image <- get_landsat_imagery(\n  aoi,\n  start_date = \"2022-06-01\",\n  end_date = \"2022-08-30\",\n  output_filename = tempfile(fileext = \".tif\")\n)\nterra::plot(terra::rast(landsat_image))\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nNote that we\u2019ve been plotting each band individually so far by calling\n`terra::plot()`. We could also use `terra::plotRGB()` (after\n`terra::stretch()`ing the band values) to see what this mosaic of images\nwould look like to the human eye:\n\n``` r\nlandsat_image |>\n  terra::rast(lyrs = c(\"R\", \"G\", \"B\")) |>\n  terra::stretch() |>\n  terra::plotRGB()\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nBy default, these functions download data from Microsoft\u2019s Planetary\nComputer API, using a number of configuration options set in\n`rsi_band_mapping` objects provided by the package. You can see these\ndefault configuration options by printing the band mapping objects, and\ncan adjust them through arguments to any `get_*` function in the\npackage.\n\n``` r\nlandsat_band_mapping$planetary_computer_v1\n#> An rsi band mapping object with attributes:\n#> names mask_band mask_function stac_source collection_name query_function download_function sign_function class\n#> \n#> coastal    blue   green     red   nir08  swir16  swir22    lwir  lwir11 \n#>     \"A\"     \"B\"     \"G\"     \"R\"     \"N\"    \"S1\"    \"S2\"     \"T\"    \"T1\"\n```\n\nWe can put these pieces together and calculate as many spectral indices\nas we can based on our downloaded Landsat imagery. The\n`calculate_indices()` function, well, calculates indices, using subsets\nof our `spectral_indices()` data frame:\n\n``` r\navailable_indices <- filter_bands(\n  bands = names(terra::rast(landsat_image))\n)\n\nindices <- calculate_indices(\n  landsat_image,\n  available_indices,\n  output_filename = tempfile(fileext = \".tif\")\n)\n#> |---------|---------|---------|---------|=========================================                                          \n\n# Plot the first handful of spatial indices\nterra::plot(terra::rast(indices))\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nAnd last but not least, rsi includes a utility for efficiently combining\nrasters containing different data about the same location into a\n[VRT](https://gdal.org/en/latest/drivers/raster/vrt.html), which allows\nprograms like GDAL to treat these separate data sources as a single\nfile. For instance, we can combine our Landsat imagery with the derived\nindices:\n\n``` r\nraster_stack <- stack_rasters(\n  c(landsat_image, indices),\n  tempfile(fileext = \".vrt\")\n)\n\n# The first few panels are now Landsat measurements, not indices:\nterra::plot(terra::rast(raster_stack))\n```\n\n<img src=\"man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png\" width=\"100%\" />\n\nThis can be extremely useful as a way to create predictor bricks and\nother multi-band rasters from various data sources.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Example", "parent_header": ["rsi <a href=\"https://permian-global-research.github.io/rsi/\"><img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"138\" alt=\"rsi website\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "rsi"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}], "repository_status": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://www.repostatus.org/#active", "description": "Active \u2013 The project has reached a stable, usable\nstate and is being actively\ndeveloped."}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}], "logo": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/man/figures/logo.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}], "images": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-5-1.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Permian-Global-Research/rsi/main/README.Rmd"}]}
