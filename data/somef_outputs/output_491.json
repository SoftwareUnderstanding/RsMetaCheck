The release also improves documentation, particularly the Stan reference, making it easier for users to navigate and work with the Stan code.\r\n\r\n## Package\r\n\r\n- Added new functions to compute quantiles of the primary censored distribution:\r\n  - `pcens_quantile()`: Core implementation using numerical optimisation to find\r\n    quantiles by inverting the CDF. The implementation allows for analytical\r\n    solutions to be added in future versions using the same interface as `pcens_cdf()`.\r\n  - `qpcens()` and `qprimarycensored()`: Convenient wrapper functions that provide\r\n    alternative interfaces to `pcens_quantile()`.\r\n- Added support to `fitdistdoublecens()` to allow for varying primary censoring windows and truncation times. As part of this refactor the interface has also been improved to allow for more flexible data input.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Removed authorship from vignettes.\r\n- Updated the `fitdistrplus` vignette to use more complex data where the relative observation time is not constant. Also removed the note that the `fitdistdoublecens()` function is limited to a single primary censoring windows and truncation time as this is no longer the case.\r\n- The [Stan Reference](https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/stan/) has been enhanced to make it easier to navigate the Stan code.\r\n\r\n## Pull requests\r\n\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/202\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/204\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/206\r\n* Issue #50: Add quantile function by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/209\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/211\r\n* Issue #71: Adds support for varying right truncation and primary windows to fitdistdoublecens by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/212\r\n* Issue #29 - Enhance stan documentation by @jamesmbaazam in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/215\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/216\r\n* Hotfix: Put stan reference update in the dev release news section. by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/217\r\n* Issue #172: Drop the authorship from vignettes by @barbora-sobolova in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/220\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/221\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/222\r\n* Bump JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action from 4.7.2 to 4.7.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/210\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @barbora-sobolova made their first contribution in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/220\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/compare/v1.1.0...v1.2.0", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/tarball/v1.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/zipball/v1.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/releases/tag/v1.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/releases/224054083", "release_id": 224054083, "date_created": "2025-06-09T14:24:53Z", "date_published": "2025-06-09T14:26:33Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/releases/199462644", "tag": "v1.1.0", "name": "primarycensored 1.1.0", "author": {"name": "seabbs", "type": "User"}, "description": "This minor release improves the documentation and the internal system used to automatically discover analytical solutions. It also adds lookups for supported supported distributions and tooling for working with these lookups. This makes it easier for package developers using `primarycensored` and also makes it easier to work with the Stan likelihood functions by improving the discoverability of the distribution functions. Minor bugs were also fixed.\r\n\r\n## Package\r\n\r\n- Updated the CI so that stan code is also tested on Windows and Mac. This is to ensure that the stan code is compatible with these platforms and in response to a CI bug in `epidist`.\r\n- Revised approach to automatic discovery of distribution functions. This soft deprecates the `pdist_name` and `dprimary_name` arguments throughout. Users wishing to pass distribution names (i.e. to potentially leverage analytical solutions) are advised to use the newly introduced `add_name_attribute()` function. Adds transient dependency on `lifecycle` and `rlang` packages. See #188 by @pearsonca.\r\n- Added `pcd_stan_dist_id()` to allow for discovery of distribution IDs for Stan models.\r\n- Added `pcd_dist_name()` to allow for discovery of distribution names for R functions as needed for `add_name_attribute()`.\r\n- Added documentation to suggest the use of `methods(pcens_cdf)` to find analytical solutions.\r\n- Added new data sets `pcd_distributions` and `pcd_primary_distributions` to document the distributions supported by `primarycensored`.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n- Added a CRAN downloads badge to the README.\r\n- Corrected how to specify an empty array in the docs of `primarycensored_lcdf()`.\r\n- All documentation was reviewed and updated to enhance readability and clarity.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Added a missing `@family` tag to the `pcens` functions. This omission resulted in the Weibull analytical solution not being visible in the package documentation.\r\n- Added precalculation of vector sizes to the `primarycensored_cdf()` stan function, avoiding errors on some platforms due to narrowing conversions in aggregate initialisation.\r\n- Changed `D` to be of type real in `pcens_model.stan` in order to support infinite `relative_obs_time`.\r\n- Switched to using `num_elements()` over `size()` in all stan code to resolve compilation issues on some platforms as reported by @sbfnk.\r\n\r\n## Pull requests\r\n\r\n*

All paths to the stan code have been updated to reflect this.\r\n* Added R and stan implementations of the primary censored cdf for the weibull distribution with uniform primary censoring.\r\n* The package has been renamed to `primarycensored` as have all functions that use \"dist\" in their name.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n* Simplified the \"Analytic solutions\" vignette by removing verbose derivation details.\r\n* Added links between vignettes to make it easier to navigate the documentation.\r\n* Added explicit usage of `pdist`, `dprimary`, `rdist`, and `rprimary` arguments in the getting started vignette to make it easier to link to mathematical details.\r\n* Fixed error in \"Analytic solutions\" vignette where the Weibull density was not being treated as zero for negative delays.\r\n* Split \"Why it works\" vignette into two separate vignettes, \"Why it works\" and \"Analytic solutions for censored delay distributions\"\r\n\r\n## Pull requests\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/103\r\n* Issue 72: Split why it works vignette into intro and analytic solutions vignette by @SamuelBrand1 in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/106\r\n* Bump JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action from 4.6.4 to 4.6.8 by @dependabot in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/110\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/111\r\n* use local environment for `fitdist` call by @sbfnk in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/113\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/114\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/115\r\n* Issue #84: Prune not helpful to arg flow maths by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/116\r\n* Issue #82: Link between vignettes by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/118\r\n* Issue #69: Add check_truncation by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/120\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/121\r\n* Issue 109: Add explicit dist and primary arg usage to getting started by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/122\r\n* Issue 70: Restructure stan code by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/123\r\n* Issue 125: Update analytic solutions to deal with possible neg t values by @SamuelBrand1 in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/126\r\n* Issue 94: Add R and Stan for analytical Weibull by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/109\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/128\r\n* Issue #108: Rename from primarycensoreddist to primarycensored by @seabbs in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/130\r\n* Update README by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/132\r\n* Update codemeta.json by @github-actions in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/131\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @sbfnk made their first contribution in https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/pull/113\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.0", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/tarball/v0.6.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/zipball/v0.6.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/releases/tag/v0.6.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/releases/179159789", "release_id": 179159789, "date_created": "2024-10-09T17:04:03Z", "date_published": "2024-10-09T17:04:59Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/epinowcast/primarycensored/releases/176252058", "tag": "v0.5.0", "name": "primarycensoreddist 0.5.0", "author": {"name": "seabbs", "type": "User"}, "description": "This release adds a new `{touchstone}` based benchmark suite to the package.

We recommend using the\n[`cmdstanr` package](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/). The Stan team\nprovides instructions in the [*Getting started with\n`cmdstanr`*](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html)\nvignette, with other details and support at the [package\nsite](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) along with some key instructions\navailable in the [Stan resources package\nvignette](https://package.epinowcast.org/articles/stan-help.html#toolchain),\nbut the brief version is:\n\n``` r\n# if you not yet installed `primarycensored`, or you installed it without\n# `Suggests` dependencies\ninstall.packages(\n  \"cmdstanr\",\n  repos = c(\"https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev\", getOption(\"repos\"))\n)\n# once `cmdstanr` is installed:\ncmdstanr::install_cmdstan()\n```\n\n*Note: You can speed up CmdStan installation using the `cores` argument.\nIf you are installing a particular version of `epinowcast`, you may also\nneed to install a past version of CmdStan, which you can do with the\n`version` argument.*\n\n</details>\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Installation", "parent_header": ["Primary event censored distributions <a href=\"https://primarycensored.epinowcast.org/\"><img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"139\" alt=\"primarycensored website\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epinowcast/primarycensored/main/README.Rmd"}], "contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "We welcome contributions and new contributors!
