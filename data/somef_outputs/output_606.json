Register Encoda so that it can be discovered by other executors on your machine,\n\n```bash\nnpm run register\n```\n\nYou can then use Encoda as a plugin for Executa that provides additional format conversion capabilities. For example, you can use the `query` REPL on a Markdown document:\n\n```bash\nnpx executa query CHANGELOG.md --repl\n```\n\nYou can then use the REPL to explore the structure of the document and do things like create summary documents from it. For example, lets say from some reason we wanted to create a short JATS XML file with the five most recent releases of this package:\n\n```\njmp > %format jats\njmp > %dest latest-releases.jats.xml\njmp > {type: 'Article', content: content[? type==`Heading` && depth==`1`] | [1:5]}\n```\n\nWhich creates the `latest-major-releases.jats.xml` file:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE article PUBLIC \"-//NLM//DTD JATS (Z39.96) Journal Archiving and Interchange DTD v1.1 20151215//EN\" \"JATS-archivearticle1.dtd\">\n<article xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" article-type=\"research-article\">\n    <front>\n        <title-group>\n            <article-title/>\n        </title-group>\n        <contrib-group/>\n    </front>\n    <body>\n        <sec>\n            <title>\n                <ext-link ext-link-type=\"uri\" xlink:href=\"https://github.com/stencila/encoda/compare/v0.79.0...v0.80.0\">0.80.0</ext-link> (2019-09-30)\n            </title>\n        </sec>\n...\n```\n\nYou can query a document in any format supported by Encoda. As another example, lets' fetch a CSV file from Github and get the names of it's columns:\n\n```bash\nnpx executa query
