Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  We use [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Contributor license agreement\n\nContributors agree to reassign the copyright of their contributions to the\nmaintainers of the package.\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
