When you post, please abide by the following guidelines.\n\n* Before posting a new issue, please take a moment to search for existing similar issues in order to avoid duplication.\n* For bug reports: if you can, please install the latest GitHub version of `targets` (i.e. `remotes::install_github(\"ropensci/targets\")`) and verify that the issue still persists.\n* Describe your issue in prose as clearly and concisely as possible.\n* Include diagnostic details about the problem, including\n    * A [reproducible example](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex).\n    * Session info, available through `sessionInfo()` or [`reprex(si = TRUE)`](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex).\n    * A stack trace from `traceback()` or `rlang::trace_back()`.\n    * The [SHA-1 hash](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Git-Basics#Git-Has-Integrity) of the GitHub commit of `targets` currently installed. `packageDescription(\"targets\")$GithubSHA1` shows you this.\n    \n## Development\n\nExternal code contributions are extremely helpful in the right circumstances. Here are the recommended steps.\n\n1. Prior to contribution, please propose your idea in a [new issue thread](https://github.com/ropensci-books/targets/issues) so you and the maintainer can define the intent and scope of your work.\n2. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n3. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to create a new branch, add commits, and open a pull request.\n4. Discuss your code with the maintainer in the pull request thread.\n5. If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge your code into the project.\n\nPlease also follow these additional guidelines.\n\n* Respect the architecture and reasoning of the project.\n* If possible, keep contributions small enough to easily review manually. It is okay to split up your work into multiple pull requests.\n* Format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and check your formatting with the `lint_package()` function from the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package.\n* Describe your contribution in the project's [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/ropensci-books/targets/blob/main/NEWS.md) file. Be sure to mention relevent GitHub issue numbers and your GitHub name as done in existing news entries.\n* If you feel contribution is substantial enough for official author or contributor status, please add yourself as an author in the  [`index.Rmd`](https://github.com/ropensci-books/targets/blob/main/index.Rmd) file and [`DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/ropensci-books/targets/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_build_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "format": "description"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "targets.manual", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "version": [{"result": {"value": "1.11.1", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci-books/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "citHeader(\"The targets manual is part of targets.
