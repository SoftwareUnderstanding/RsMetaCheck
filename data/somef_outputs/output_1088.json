This can be changed using the parameter include_land = FALSE. By default, both ocean and land occurrences are included. Please note: this are geographical filters, they do not discriminate by taxa. Furthermore, since cubes contain pre-aggregated data, occurrences within grid cells that overlap both land and ocean cannot be excluded, regardless of whether the occurrences themselves are on land or ocean.\r\n* The user can now select the output CRS when plotting, independently of the CRS of the indicator object. This can be done using the parameter output_crs. By default, output_crs is NULL and will use the CRS of the indicator object.\r\n* Grid line width and colour, and the fill colour of empty grid cells can now be customized using the parameters grid_line_width, grid_line_colour, and grid_fill_colour.\r\n* The width and colour of the grid outline can also be customized using the parameters grid_outline_width and grid_outline_colour.\r\n* The grid outline is turned off by default, but can be turned on using the parameter visible_grid_outline = TRUE.\r\n* The grid outline can be plotted as a complete rectangle even when the grid is not, using complete_grid_outline.

Use 'transformed' to force a proper rectangular shape regardless of the projection.

This can be done using the parameter crop_by_region = TRUE. Note that this only works if you specified one or more region(s) when calculating the indicator, not if you used level = 'cube'. By default, crop_by_region is set to FALSE.\r\n* Colours and fill colours for each rnaturalearth layer that the user specifies when plotting a map can now be customized using the parameters layer_colours and layer_fill_colours. The user must provide a vector of colours that matches the order and number of layers specified in the layers parameter.\r\n* Panel grid lines can now be turned on using the parameter visible_panel_gridlines.

Contributing to b3gbi\n\nThis outlines how to propose a change to b3gbi.\nFor a detailed discussion on contributing to this and other tidyverse packages, please see the [development contributing guide](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib) and our [code review principles](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/).\n\n## Fixing typos\n\nYou can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. \nThis generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. \nYou can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n## Bigger changes\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s needed. \nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).\nSee our guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"b-cubed-eu/b3gbi\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the b3gbi project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of\nactions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.
