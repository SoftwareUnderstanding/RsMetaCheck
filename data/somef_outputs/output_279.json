It is\nreleased under the MIT license. Gophersat is rather efficient, i.e on\ntypical SAT benchmarks it runs about 2 to 5 times slower than top-level\nsolvers (namely, [glucose](http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/) or\n[minisat](http://minisat.se/)) from which it is strongly inspired.\nIt can also solve MAXSAT problems, and pseudo-boolean decision and optimization problems.\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Gophersat, a SAT and pseudo-boolean solver written in Go"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crillab/gophersat/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Gophersat's last stable version is version 1.4.

The answer is obvious: if you have 4 pigeons in 3 holes, you can't put them all in a different hole. But how do you *prove* this? A SAT or PB solver will prove it by trying all possible combinations, and the number of possible combinations grows exponentially. So, trying to solve the problem with n=20 is not feasible in practice, despite the problem having an obvious answer.\n\nSome PB solvers implement an alternative strategy: the cutting-planes strategy. It won't be described in detail in this document, but this stategy can be extremely efficient on some problems, such as the pigeonhole problem which cannot be solved efficiently by pure logical reasoning, but will be slower on most problems.\n\nIt is now possible to use the cutting-planes with Gophersat.
