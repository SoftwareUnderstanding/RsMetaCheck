`clusterenrich()` and `simplenrich()` functions to now compute enrichment ratios for functionally enriched biological functions\r\n- Added download method choice for the `dl_regulation_data()` function to provide more flexibility\r\n- Fixed issue in dataframe merging for both `clustrfusion()` and `lonelyfishing()` \r\n\r\n### Side-quests\r\n\r\n- Enhanced documentation in scripts for reproducing results (figures and tables) from the associated paper\r\n- Corrected subtle issues in table generation (e.g., selecting only GO:BP terms for the enrichment results, although KEGG and WP pathways were enriched)\r\n- Added graphical abstract illustration from the associated paper to both the root **`README.md`** and vignette\r\n- Applied minor fixes and text adjustements throughout the
