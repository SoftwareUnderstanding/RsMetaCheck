Austin McCoy and Dr. Zachary Noel at Michigan State University in the US, where the disease has been managed primarily via deployment of resistance genes (*Rps* genes, resistance to *P. sojae*) in commercial soybean cultivars and by the application of fungicide seed treatments.\nHowever, repeated use of resistance genes can cause populations to adapt over time rendering these resistance genes ineffective.\nTo determine current effectiveness of resistance genes for managing *P. sojae*, state-wide surveys (in the US) are conducted to determine the pathotype (previously referred to as \"race\") structure within sampled population of *P. sojae*. \nHowever, the package is not only useful for *P. sojae* work.\nIt was built to be useful for other plant pathogen gene-for-gene interaction systems, *e.g.*, wheat rusts, but it has been used in animal science as well, see [Cain *et al.* 2022](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13071-022-05533-y). \nThe goal of this package is to provide all the necessary analyses needed when conducting a pathotype surveys, including: distribution of susceptibilities (effective and non-effective resistance genes), distribution of pathotype complexities with statistics, pathotype frequency distribution, as well as diversity indices for pathotypes in an efficient and reproducible manner. \n", "original_header": "Overview"}, "confidence":

If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal\n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n- We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).\n- Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.\n  The `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\n  by the package.\n- We use [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/) to format our code.\n  Please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.\n- We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).\n- We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\n  with test cases included are easier to accept.\n- For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\n  current development version header describing the changes made followed by your\n  GitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the {hagis} project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
