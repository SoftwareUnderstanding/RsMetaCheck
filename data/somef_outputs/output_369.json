By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).\n\nWe have prepared a [document][developer] describing how independent developers can contribute to dartR. This document explains the structure of the functions in dartR, programming style, the data structure of the genlight object used in dartR, workflow and many other topics. \n\n### Share the love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThink dartR is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.\n\nIf you use dartR in your research, please support us by citing dartR. You can find the citation information by typing in the R console:\n\n```{r}I\ncitation(\"dartR\u201d)\n```\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing dartR and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][website] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question in our [Google groups forum][new_issue] and we'll try to do our best to address it.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][mailto:email].\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new dartR feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [issue list][issues] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing dartR and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:\n\n* Your operating system name and version (e.g. Mac OS 10.13.6).\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation. If not, [report an issue][new_issue] and we can point you in the right direction.\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for dartR? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6.

Let\u2019s get started by reading your genetic data into `dartR`; if you\n    have DArT data, follow [this\n    tutorial](http://georges.biomatix.org/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/tutorial3adartrdatastructuresandinput22-dec-21-2.pdf);\n    if not, follow [this\n    one](http://georges.biomatix.org/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/tutorial3bdartrdatastructuresandinputfromsourcesotherthandartlmagv2-2.pdf).\n\n3.  Checking out our [data manipulation\n    tutorial](http://georges.biomatix.org/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/tutorial4dartrdatamanipulation22-dec-21-3.pdf)\n    is the easiest way to get your feet wet with `dartR`.\n\n4.  [This\n    tutorial](http://georges.biomatix.org/storage/app/media/uploaded-files/tutorial5dartrbasicfiltering22-dec-21-2.pdf)\n    will provide some pointers on how to filter your data effectively,\n    an important step that depends on making sound threshold\n    assessments.\n\n5.  Check out our [simulations\n    tutorial](https://github.com/green-striped-gecko/dartR/wiki/Simulations-tutorial)\n    to learn more about our simulation model, a powerful tool for\n    illuminating intricate evolutionary and genetic processes.\n\n6.
