See the \n[Table of contents](#table-of-contents) for different ways to help and details \nabout how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant \nsection before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us \nmaintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved.\n\n\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- [Style guide](#style-guide)\n- [Commit messages](#commit-messages)\n- [Asking questions](#asking-questions)\n- [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n- [Requesting features](#requesting-features)\n- [Contributing code](#contributing-code)\n\n\n\n## Style guide\n\nI have used the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for writing R \ncode. Functions are documented with the \n[roxygen2](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) syntax. \n`mapindia` uses the `lower_snake_case`.\n\n\n\n## Commit messages\n\nIf you want to contribute by commiting changes, please try to use the \n[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) \nspecification.\n\n\n\n## Asking questions\n\nBefore you ask a question, it is best to search for existing\n[Issues](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues) that might help \nyou. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you \ncan write your question in this issue.\n\nIf you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, I \nrecommend the following:\n\n- Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues/new).\n- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.\n- Provide project and platform versions (paste the output of `sessionInfo()`).\n\nI will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\n\n\n### Before submitting a bug report\n\nI ask you to investigate carefully, collect information\nand describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following \nsteps in advance to help me fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version of `mapindia`.\n- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side.\n- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the \nsame issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing \nfor your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues?q=label%3Abug).\n\n\n\n### How do I submit a bug report?\n\nPlease use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues) to \ntrack bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:\n\n- Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues/new).\n- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.\n- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the \n*reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on \ntheir own. This usually includes your code with a reproducible example.\n\nI will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n## Requesting features\n\n\n\n### Before requesting a feature\n\n- Make sure that you are using the latest version of `mapindia`.\n- Read the [documentation](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/)\ncarefully and find out if the functionality is already covered.\n- Perform a [search](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues) to \nsee if this enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to \nthe existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n\n\n\n### How do I submit a feature request?\n\nFeature requests are tracked as \n[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues).\n\n- Open a new [Issue](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/issues/new).\n- Provide a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.\n- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as \nmany details as possible.\n- Explain why this enhancement would be useful to most `mapindia` users.\n\nI will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n## Contributing code\n\n\n\n### General workflow\n\nI use the [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) \nto collaborate on this project:\n\n\n1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) \nthis repository using the GitHub interface.\n1. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) \nyour fork using `git clone fork-url` (replace `fork-url` by the URL of your fork). \nAlternatively, open RStudio IDE and create a New Project from Version Control.\n1. Create a new branch w/ `git checkout -b branch-name` (replace `branch-name` \nby the name of your new branch).\n1. Make your contribution (see below for examples).\n1. Stage (`git add`) and commit (`git commit`) your changes as often as necessary\n1. Push your changes to GitHub w/ `git push origin branch-name`.\n3. Submit a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects#making-a-pull-request) on the [original repo](https://github.com/shubhamdutta26/mapindia/compare).\n\nI will then review the PR as soon as possible.\n\n\n\n### Improve documentation\n\n\n\n#### Editing the README\n\nIf you want to contribute by improving the README, please edit the `README.Rmd` \n(not the `README.md`).
