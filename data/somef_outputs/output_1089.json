This means that the `[experimental_feature] high_dpi_mode` in the configuration is now always `true`.\r\n- Several (potentially, but unlikely, breaking) changes to the shared geometry/ directory and example models were made.

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/blob/0.5.17/CHANGELOG.md) for specific changes.\r\n- The Coordinates panel now contains a `Pose` dropdown that exposes the ability to zero all joint coordinates in the model (thanks @tgeijten, #959).\r\n- The socket reassignment popup was given a makeover, and tries to draw more attention to the `Re-Express $COMPONENT in new frame` option (thanks @tgeijten, #957).\r\n- The \"Frame Definition\" workflow is now labelled as deprecated, because we anticipate that it isn't used very much. If you think otherwise, then post a comment on issue #951.\r\n- Fixed a regression where the `Display` context menu would always be greyed out in the model editor (thanks @tgeijten, #958).\r\n- Fixed 'Wireframe' appearance causing the component's decoration to disappear, rather than showing as a wireframe (#952).", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.5.17", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.5.17", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.5.17", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/190352287", "release_id": 190352287, "date_created": "2024-12-11T14:01:15Z", "date_published": "2024-12-12T05:59:03Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/212811623", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.17-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 21104681, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.17/opensimcreator-0.5.17-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2024-12-12T05:38:06Z", "download_count": 32}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/225166909", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.17-src.tar.xz", "content_size": 127279156, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.17/opensimcreator-0.5.17-src.tar.xz", "encoding_format": "application/x-compressed", "upload_date": "2025-01-31T13:43:45Z", "download_count": 3}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/212811618", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.17-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 13713058, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.17/opensimcreator-0.5.17-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-msdownload", "upload_date": "2024-12-12T05:38:03Z", "download_count": 144}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/212811616", "name": "opensimcreator_0.5.17_amd64.deb", "content_size": 21898838, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.17/opensimcreator_0.5.17_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2024-12-12T05:37:57Z", "download_count": 17}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/183569895", "tag": "0.5.16", "name": "0.5.16: Muscle color scaling, smaller installer, and more documentation", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "0.5.16 is a patch release that focuses on improving how the software is packaged and its documentation, with a few nice-to-haves thrown in for good measure.

The documentation has been updated (also work-in-progress), more details available in the CHANGELOG.\r\n- The simulator tab now has much more similar behavior to the model editor tab, in terms of supported panels. E.g. you can now view the coordinates panel while viewing a simulation.\r\n- Viewing function curves has been improved.

exception then the editor window will now try to close the popup, rather than fully erroring out to an error tab (thanks @AdrianHendrik, #800)\r\n- Fixed a bug where trying to add a ConditionalPathPoint, Marker, PathPoint, PhysicalOffsetFrame, or Station component via the Add menu would crash the tab with a frame-related error message (thanks @AdrianHendrik, #800)\r\n- Internal: the codebase now contains shape-fitting algorithms for fitting a sphere, plane, or ellipsoid analytic geometry to mesh data. The algorithms were written to closely match the shape-fitting codebase that came with \"P.Bishop et. al, How to Build a Dinosaur, doi:10.1017/pab.2020.46\" (#798)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.5.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.5.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.5.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/127853728", "release_id": 127853728, "date_created": "2023-11-03T08:15:23Z", "date_published": "2023-11-03T11:20:38Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/133759405", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.4-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 152509464, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.4/opensimcreator-0.5.4-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2023-11-03T11:17:13Z", "download_count": 30}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/225164543", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.4-src.tar.xz", "content_size": 170163292, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.4/opensimcreator-0.5.4-src.tar.xz", "encoding_format": "application/x-compressed", "upload_date": "2025-01-31T13:32:29Z", "download_count": 2}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/133759561", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.4-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 131823694, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.4/opensimcreator-0.5.4-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-msdownload", "upload_date": "2023-11-03T11:18:06Z", "download_count": 85}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/133759702", "name": "opensimcreator_0.5.4_amd64.deb", "content_size": 156292194, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.4/opensimcreator_0.5.4_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2023-11-03T11:18:52Z", "download_count": 13}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/124224741", "tag": "0.5.3", "name": "0.5.3: Persistent viewport settings and import stations from CSV (+other changes)", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "0.5.3 adds support for persisting 3D viewport options between boots of OSC, which is handy if you have preferred visualization options that you typically always toggle on/off.

For example, it has support for defining landmarks, midpoints, edges between points, cross product edges, and frames that are defined w.r.t. those points/edges. This enables users to visually place frames on bone scans according to ISB rules with visual feedback and on-the-fly calculations, which should be useful to model builders.\r\n\r\nThe mesh warping workflow introduces a UI for the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) algorithm. The UI asks users to pair landmarks from two separate meshes in order to create a TPS warping kernel. The warping kernel can be then be used to warp any point in 3D space. We anticipate that this will be a useful tool for performing morphology-driven model scaling and creating blended models.\r\n\r\nThe \"workflows\" feature, including the frame definition and mesh warping workflows, are work in progress. If you think something is missing, or broken, report it on the issues page. We anticipate that interesting features from each specific workflow (e.g. the calculate feature in the frame definition UI) will gradually be ported to existing UIs (e.g. the model editor).\r\n\r\n## Other Highlights\r\n\r\n- 3D renderers are now correctly gamma-corrected, which makes the visualizations look nicer (#600)\r\n- Added support for editing int property values, which is handy for some component types (e.g. PrescribedController, #704)\r\n- Selected elements (e.g. when selecting a frame in an add component dialog) are now easier to differentiate from not-selected elements in the UI (thanks @aseth, #677)\r\n- Various internal changes were made to OSC to support generalized workflow UIs and splitting the OSC engine from OpenSimCreator (e.g. for creating other tooling UIs)\r\n\r\nSee CHANGELOG.md for a full list of changes.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.5.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.5.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.5.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/111835637", "release_id": 111835637, "date_created": "2023-07-11T13:15:54Z", "date_published": "2023-07-11T18:07:17Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/116561225", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 62256596, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.0/opensimcreator-0.5.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2023-07-11T18:06:13Z", "download_count": 29}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/225162688", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.0-src.tar.xz", "content_size": 79579280, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.0/opensimcreator-0.5.0-src.tar.xz", "encoding_format": "application/x-compressed", "upload_date": "2025-01-31T13:21:37Z", "download_count": 3}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/116561279", "name": "opensimcreator-0.5.0-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 42966153, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.0/opensimcreator-0.5.0-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-msdownload", "upload_date": "2023-07-11T18:06:45Z", "download_count": 73}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/116561195", "name": "opensimcreator_0.5.0_amd64.deb", "content_size": 66171100, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.5.0/opensimcreator_0.5.0_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2023-07-11T18:05:48Z", "download_count": 13}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/99383750", "tag": "0.4.1", "name": "0.4.1: Geometry path editing, minor bugfixes, and build improvements", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "0.4.1 is a patch release that fixes some bugs that were found in 0.4.0.

The scene light's slope/height no longer tracks along with the camera, which makes the shadow angle look a little bit better (thanks @tgeijten, #549)\r\n- The \"Reload [Model]\" button now forces OSC to also reload any associated mesh files, which is handy when seperately editing mesh files in something like Maya/Blender (thanks @JuliaVanBeesel, #594)\r\n- Hotfixed a bug from OpenSim where inertia edits were not applied to the model (#597, related: opensim-core/#3395, thanks to @jesse-gilmer for spotting this :))\r\n- ... and many other changes (see the CHANGELOG)", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/94723184", "release_id": 94723184, "date_created": "2023-03-06T13:16:41Z", "date_published": "2023-03-07T05:47:31Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/98340044", "name": "opensimcreator-0.4.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 58227834, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.4.0/opensimcreator-0.4.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/x-diskcopy", "upload_date": "2023-03-07T05:44:44Z", "download_count": 38}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/225162466", "name": "opensimcreator-0.4.0-src.tar.xz", "content_size": 76820652, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.4.0/opensimcreator-0.4.0-src.tar.xz", "encoding_format": "application/x-compressed", "upload_date": "2025-01-31T13:20:03Z", "download_count": 4}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/98340071", "name": "opensimcreator-0.4.0-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 40657781, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.4.0/opensimcreator-0.4.0-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2023-03-07T05:45:31Z", "download_count": 165}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/98339952", "name": "opensimcreator_0.4.0_amd64.deb", "content_size": 62146956, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.4.0/opensimcreator_0.4.0_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2023-03-07T05:43:23Z", "download_count": 31}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/88304650", "tag": "0.3.2", "name": "0.3.2: Minor updates and bugfixes", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "0.3.2 is a patch release that contains a bunch of bug fixes, along with some minor quality-of-life improvements.\r\n\r\n0.3.1 is missing because a crash was spotted last-minute (#418). 0.3.2 fixes that bug, along with fixing other things, and includes some minor quality-of-life improvements.

See the CHANGELOG if you'd like to know all of them.\r\n\r\nHere are some highlights:\r\n\r\n- NEW: \"Muscle Plotting\" (right-click a muscle, \"Plot vs. Coordinate\") is now greatly improved. It live-plots a muscle curve whenever edits are made, saves previous curves, enables users to lock previous curves, and revert to previous model versions, along with support for CSV import/export (#352 #346 #354 #355 #353 #365 #364 #363 #366 #362 #361 #367 #359 #370 #368 #371 #230 #231 #394 #409 #398 #395).\r\n\r\n- NEW: \"Output Watches\" panel in the editor. You can now right-click anything in the 3D editor, hierarchy, etc. and watch any associated OpenSim output of that thing (e.g. muscle stiffness, model kinetic energy, etc.). Editing the model automatically updates the output watch's value (#356).\r\n\r\n- The 3D rendering backend was entirely rewritten. In general, 3D renders should look better, and have better performance. Please report any funky behavior/crashes to the GitHub issues page.\r\n\r\n- The backend was upgraded from OpenSim 4.3 to OpenSim 4.4. In general, it is a little bit faster and is more stable in multithreaded contexts (#330)\r\n\r\n- You can now show/hide model components more easily in the editor. The behavior is similar to OpenSim GUI (#415).\r\n\r\n- The mesh importer has more translation options (e.g. \"translate to mass center\", #88, #92).\r\n\r\n- There is now basic support for exporting any 3D viewport's content to a `.dae` file, for rendering the scene in external software, such as Blender. The feature is hidden away in each viewport's `scene` menu for now, until it's improved (#314)\r\n\r\n- The new rendererer is more resilient to meshes that that have inconsistent triangle windings or normals (#318). This is particularly useful if you work with custom meshes built from (e.g.) X-ray data.\r\n\r\n- The mouse is handled more consistently in the editor screen's panels. Left-click usually selects stuff. Right-click usually opens a context menu (previously: panels like the hierarchy panel behaved differently)\r\n\r\n- Some (effectively) \"crash the UI\" buttons have been temporarily removed until the backend can handle the edge-cases better (#329 #331). This also applies to the mesh importer (#331).\r\n\r\n- The \"Add Component\" menus in the editor have been put into the main menu and right-click context menu. They are now cleaner and contain fewer duplicated entries (#312)\r\n\r\n- You can now visualize OpenSim Scapulothoracic joints by ticking a checkbox in a 3D viewport's \"scene\" menu (#334)\r\n\r\n- Plus a bunch of other UX improvements, stability improvements, crash hardening, etc. changes (see CHANGELOG.md)", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/77257020", "release_id": 77257020, "date_created": "2022-09-14T07:25:41Z", "date_published": "2022-09-15T07:18:06Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/77932315", "name": "opensimcreator-0.3.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 61232227, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.3.0/opensimcreator-0.3.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2022-09-15T07:15:53Z", "download_count": 60}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/77932426", "name": "opensimcreator-0.3.0-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 38423831, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.3.0/opensimcreator-0.3.0-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-msdownload", "upload_date": "2022-09-15T07:17:33Z", "download_count": 178}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/77932362", "name": "opensimcreator_0.3.0_amd64.deb", "content_size": 64766788, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.3.0/opensimcreator_0.3.0_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2022-09-15T07:16:42Z", "download_count": 42}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/71204683", "tag": "0.2.0", "name": "0.2.0: Tabbed interface and more", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "> Tabbed interface support, alternate muscle visualization options, OpenSim 4.3 support, live muscle plotting, simulation performance measurements, and a variety of other improvements.\r\n\r\nOpenSim Creator 0.2.0 contains all of the features that have been rolled out since 0.1.0 (6th Feb) and beyond, including the new tabbed interface but, unlike smaller releases, this release has been QAed against a more comprehensive series of checks including (e.g.) things like exercising all memory allocations with libASAN. Any user-facing documentation has also been updated to reflect any UI changes that have been implemented since 0.1.0.\r\n\r\nUsers should find that the new (tabbed) UI is easier to work with - especially when running multiple simulations or working with multiple models. Live muscle plotting support, along with coordinates now being saved to the model as actual model edits, should make it much easier to tweak a model's parameters + configuration. Alternate muscle visualizations, including the ability to view tendons, should also be useful for users that need to tweak (e.g.) tendon lengths.\r\n\r\nFuture releases are likely to focus on pushing model-editing, including in-editor support for editing muscle paths. There is also a desire to expand the live-plotting feature with support for importing muscle curves from 3rd-party sources, and to live-plot any model output (e.g. marker position, acceleration), rather than only muscle outputs (e.g. moment arm, activation).\r\n\r\nSee the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) for a comprehensive list of all changes.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/71204683", "release_id": 71204683, "date_created": "2022-07-04T08:39:24Z", "date_published": "2022-07-04T14:15:11Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/70527328", "name": "opensimcreator-0.2.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 47496502, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.2.0/opensimcreator-0.2.0-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2022-07-04T14:13:28Z", "download_count": 50}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/70527361", "name": "opensimcreator-0.2.0-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 42324215, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.2.0/opensimcreator-0.2.0-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-msdownload", "upload_date": "2022-07-04T14:14:11Z", "download_count": 189}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/70527176", "name": "opensimcreator_0.2.0_amd64.deb", "content_size": 102041754, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.2.0/opensimcreator_0.2.0_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/octet-stream", "upload_date": "2022-07-04T14:11:58Z", "download_count": 40}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/66665885", "tag": "0.1.6", "name": "0.1.6: Tendon Visualization, Muscle plotting, OpenSim 4.3", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "New muscle visualization options, experimental support for live muscle plots, and OpenSim 4.3 support:\r\n\r\n- Muscle tendons can now be visualized in the 3D viewer (#165):\r\n\r\n  - You can try this out by experimenting with the new dropdown menus that were added to the `Options` menu,\r\n    available in each 3D viewer panel\r\n  - Muscle decoration style can now be changed (e.g. to SCONE-style) in the 3D viewer's options menu (#188)\r\n  - Muscle coloring logic can now be changed in the 3D viewer's options menu (#189)\r\n  - Muscle thickness logic can now be changed (e.g. to PCSA-derived) in the 3D viewer's options menu (#190)\r\n\r\n- (EXPERIMENTAL) There is now partial support for plotting muscle parameters (e.g. moment arm, pennation angle)\r\n  against a particular coordinate (e.g. `knee_angle_r`) in the model editor (see #191):\r\n\r\n  - The easiest way to do this is to right-click a muscle `Add Muscle Plot vs` and then select a coordinate (#196)\r\n  - Alternatively, add a new plot panel via the `Window` menu in the editor's main menu\r\n  - You can right-click a plot to change what it's plotting\r\n  - You can left-click a plot to change the coordinate's value (#195)\r\n  - The plot will auto-update whenever either the model is edited or a state is edited (e.g. by changing a\r\n    coordinate value).

It also changes the installation location of OpenSim Creator in Windows to ensure that newer versions overwrite older ones.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Important**: The default installation location of OpenSim Creator has changed. \r\n\r\nIn general, the new location(s) do not contain a version number and installing newer versions of OpenSim Creator will overwrite the older versions. The reason for doing this was to prevent the confusion caused by allowing multiple versions to be installed concurrently, which would create multiple start menu shortcuts, etc. and make it difficult to know whether the latest version is being used after an upgrade.\r\n\r\n- e.g. **Windows**. Old location = `C:\\Program Files\\osc ${version}`. New location = `C:\\Program Files\\OpenSimCreator\\`\r\n\r\nYou should manually uninstall older versions of OpenSim Creator to ensure that you are always running the latest version.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nChangelog:\r\n\r\n- 3D viewer panels now have a close button\r\n- 3D viewers now have zoom in and zoom out buttons under `scene`, to help users that can't scroll easily\r\n- Setting the mass in the `add body` popup now correctly sets the mass of the added body\r\n- Plotting an output subfield (e.g. `angular_velocity.x`) now correctly displays it in the output plots and output CSV export\r\n- The `about` tab now contains a shortcut to open OpenSim Creator's installation directory\r\n- The `view` tab now contains a shortcut to open the currently-open `osim`'s file directory. Handy for viewing adjacent files, like STOs and Geometry.\r\n- All output plots now contain a vertical line indicating where, in time, the simulation is currently scrubbed to\r\n- Output plots can now be clicked to scrub the simulation to that point in time\r\n- Output plots now have a horizontal X axis at `Y=0.00` if the data ever crosses that boundary\r\n- The mini axis lines in the bottom-left of a 3D viewer are now bigger and labelled with X, Y, and Z\r\n- The action buttons now have an extra `+` symbol to make them slightly more visible\r\n- Contact geometry can now be removed from a `HuntCrossleyForce` in the UI\r\n- The `Selection View` panel is now hidden when editing a model: the information is redundant and appears in the `Edit Properties` panel anyway\r\n- 3D viewers now have a `Measure` button, for measuring 3D distances in the model. Click it, click where you want to start the measurement, drag to where you'd like to measure.\r\n- In addition to reassigning sockets in the `Edit Properties` panel, you can now browse to them (i.e. make them the selected component) by right-clicking them\r\n- Assigning cone geometry to a body now correctly displays cone, rather than cylinder, geometry\r\n- Fixed a bug where menu padding could break sometimes, causing all the UI elements to bunch up to the edge of UI panels\r\n- The `add_body` modal now automatically focuses the body's name when initially opened\r\n- Dragging an `.osim` file into the splash screen now loads the `osim` file in the editor\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.0.5", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.0.5", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.0.5", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/50620010", "release_id": 50620010, "date_created": "2021-09-27T09:05:54Z", "date_published": "2021-10-01T10:14:53Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/46015319", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.5-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 26100122, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.5/opensimcreator-0.0.5-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/x-apple-diskimage", "upload_date": "2021-10-01T10:13:13Z", "download_count": 13}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/225160209", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.5-src.tar.xz", "content_size": 19844532, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.5/opensimcreator-0.0.5-src.tar.xz", "encoding_format": "application/x-compressed", "upload_date": "2025-01-31T13:07:59Z", "download_count": 2}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/46015306", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.5-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 31594426, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.5/opensimcreator-0.0.5-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-ms-dos-executable", "upload_date": "2021-10-01T10:12:44Z", "download_count": 18}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/46015338", "name": "opensimcreator_0.0.5_amd64.deb", "content_size": 70194232, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.5/opensimcreator_0.0.5_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/vnd.debian.binary-package", "upload_date": "2021-10-01T10:13:34Z", "download_count": 15}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/50033625", "tag": "0.0.4", "name": "0.0.4: General release for Sep2021", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "This is the latest release of OSC. Depending on the platform, the installer may install OSC alongside previous versions. If this isn't the behavior you want (e.g. because it causes multiple OSCs to appear in your start bar) then uninstall the previous version (e.g. run `Uninstall.exe` in `C:\\Program Files\\osc` on Windows). Later versions of OSC may be packaged to do that automatically.\r\n\r\nThis contains a variety of fixes/improvements over 0.0.3, including:\r\n\r\n- A coordinate editor in the main editor screen\r\n- Limited support for ultra-large/ultra-small models, such as fly legs, by scaling the scene\r\n- The coordinate editor and hierarchy panels now have a search bar\r\n- The mouse controls are now a union of OpenSim's and Blenders, which should make OSC easier to use in a variety of circumstances (especially laptop touch pads)\r\n- The scene light now moves with the camera, so the model has no dark spots\r\n- (work in progress) In-built documentation. Currently contains two introductory tutorials. These will be improved over time.\r\n- More built-in analytical geometries are supported, such as arrows and cones\r\n- The rendering pipeline is ~20-30 % faster on lower-end devices (e.g. laptops with iGPUs)\r\n- The UI renders *much* less frequently if a user isn't interacting with it. Typically reduces resource usage by 50-70x\r\n- Rim highlights should now always show correctly, and not occasionally be occluded by other things in the scene (this was particularly annoying when rendering overlapping frames)\r\n- The camera can now zoom in very far, provided the camera's focal point is set correctly. This enables zooming into (e.g. very small features)\r\n- The camera has more keybinds (subject to change): `X`, `Ctrl+X`, `Z`, `Y` move the camera along `+X`, `-X`, `Z`, and `Y` axes respectively (`Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y` are already taken by `Undo` and `Redo`). `F` resets the camera. `Ctrl+F` automatically tries to move the camera to view the whole screne\r\n- The locale now defaults to `C`, rather than whatever the system is. This handles the edge-case of saving a file while using a locale that has decimal numbers like `3,14`. OpenSim will save the file with `3,14` but then fail to read the number in when the file is loaded later, substituting in `3`.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/tarball/0.0.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/zipball/0.0.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/tag/0.0.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/50033625", "release_id": 50033625, "date_created": "2021-09-21T14:10:23Z", "date_published": "2021-09-22T06:51:55Z", "assets": [{"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/45343957", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.4-docs.zip", "content_size": 5795628, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.4/opensimcreator-0.0.4-docs.zip", "encoding_format": "application/zip", "upload_date": "2021-09-22T06:51:40Z", "download_count": 13}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/45343650", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.4-macos-amd64.dmg", "content_size": 25995746, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.4/opensimcreator-0.0.4-macos-amd64.dmg", "encoding_format": "application/x-apple-diskimage", "upload_date": "2021-09-22T06:46:43Z", "download_count": 15}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/225159658", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.4-src.tar.xz", "content_size": 19761292, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.4/opensimcreator-0.0.4-src.tar.xz", "encoding_format": "application/x-compressed", "upload_date": "2025-01-31T13:05:50Z", "download_count": 4}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/45343727", "name": "opensimcreator-0.0.4-windows-amd64.exe", "content_size": 27977977, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.4/opensimcreator-0.0.4-windows-amd64.exe", "encoding_format": "application/x-ms-dos-executable", "upload_date": "2021-09-22T06:48:34Z", "download_count": 22}, {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/assets/45343663", "name": "osc_0.0.4_amd64.deb", "content_size": 69983598, "content_url": "https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/download/0.0.4/osc_0.0.4_amd64.deb", "encoding_format": "application/vnd.debian.binary-package", "upload_date": "2021-09-22T06:47:25Z", "download_count": 12}]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/releases/46169592", "tag": "0.0.3", "name": "General release for Jul2021", "author": {"name": "adamkewley", "type": "User"}, "description": "Contains a wide variety of improvements over 0.0.2:\r\n\r\n- OSMV (the codename for the alpha) has now internally been renamed to OSC, or OpenSim Creator. The official repository is now at https://github.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator\r\n  - This is mostly a branding change, but also renames the C++ namespaces from `osmv` to `osc`\r\n  - OSC uses the OpenSim logo, rather than the custom one that was used in earlier versions\r\n- All releases of the software now use OpenSim 4.2\r\n  - This adds support for things like ScapulothoracicJoint\r\n  - It also makes simulations slightly faster (typically, 20-40 %)\r\n  - Mac users *may* (needs verification) need to install `gfortran`: please report installation issues on fresh mac products\r\n- OpenSim's log now prints to the OSC log panel\r\n  - This means any warnings, error messages, etc. from OpenSim can be seen in the UI\r\n- Component default values are now improved\r\n  - These are the property values components have when added through the UI\r\n  - This is an ongoing process. Some components (e.g. ContactSphere) still have poor defaults (e.g. radius=0.0)\r\n- Fixed a bug where keybinds could be triggered, even when typing something into an input textbox\r\n  - This could occasionally lead to annoying situations. E.g. typing `R` (reload) into an input box would reload the model\r\n- Modal dialogs no longer trigger popups/changes in UI elements below the dialog\r\n  - E.g. mousing over something in a modal should no longer trigger tooltips, 3D scene changes, etc. below the modal\r\n- Simulation states are now saved\r\n  - This means that you can retrospectively view the entire simulation with an animation scrubber\r\n  - It also means you can retrospectively plot outputs from a previously-ran simulation\r\n  - The reporting interval is deterministic, with a fixed time step, so that data+animations are consistent (e.g. datapoints in plots will be evenly spaced)\r\n  - Simulations make their own independent copy of a model before running. This means that you can keep editing a model while a simulation runs on older versions of the model.\r\n- Simulations are now more configurable\r\n  - This means that users can change the integrator, minimum step size, maximum step size, etc. of a simulation\r\n- Multiple simulations can now be ran concurrently\r\n  - The UI provides a way for selecting which simulation is currently being viewed\r\n  - There is currently no limit, or queuing, on the parallelism - try not to let your computer explode\r\n- Simulation metadata--eg. the number of integration steps, error rates,  etc.--is now displayed on the simulation screen with basic documentation explaining each plot\r\n- Any plotted outputs can be directly exported to a CSV file\r\n  - Choose to plot an output, view a simulation, go to the \"outputs\" tab: there's now a \"Export to CSV\" button\r\n- The UI is now uses custom style colors, which are darker and less blue than the ImGui defaults\r\n- The UI now uses FontAwesome for icon support. FontAwesome icons have been added to the most commonly used actions in the UI\r\n- The component hierarchy viewer now supports expanding and contracting nodes\r\n- Switching between editing and simulation mode no longer wipes the undo/redo history of the edited model\r\n- The \"About\" menu has been tidied up and now contains more information + documentation.\r\n- The \"Experiments\" screen (accessed via the About menu) now prompts the user to select an experimental feature\r\n  - This is because we plan on using this space to ship experimental features to production early.\r\n- Added \"Windows\" tab to the main menu\r\n  - Lets users enable/disable UI panels\r\n  - Multiple 3D viewers can be enabled through this\r\n  - Currently does not save which panels were enabled/disabled between UI boots (a future version will support this)\r\n- The splash screen now contains obvious-looking \"New\" and \"Open\" buttons right above the main content\r\n  - This is so that new users don't have to search around in the \"File\" tab of the main menu\r\n- Example filenames are now sorted case-insensitively, so that they appear to be logically alphabetical (e.g. A, a, B b vs. A B a b)\r\n- 3D viewers now use Blender-like keybindings\r\n  - e.g. Left/Right click interact with things. Middle mouse for swiveling, CTRL+middle mouse to pan, etc.\r\n  - This is because it's fairly common for model builders to also be using blender\r\n- You can now add muscles to a model through the UI\r\n  - Requires selecting N>1 bodies/frames in the model\r\n  - Currently, there is no support for rearranging the attachment order\r\n- You can now add geometry to a body/frame\r\n  - Previously, you could *assign* geometry to a body/frame, which would overwrite any previous assignments\r\n  - Adding enables adding multiple pieces of geometry to a single body/frame\r\n  - You can delete geometry by pressing DEL while geometry is selected\r\n- Added support for attaching analytical geometry (cubes, spheres, etc.)\r\n  - The benefit of using these is that the resulting model file is less dependent on external mesh files (the geometry is generated in-code by OSC)\r\n- The loading screen now has a progress bar\r\n  - The progress bar always marches forward and is no indication of actual progress: purely there to show the UI is doing *something*\r\n- **Experimental**: Added mesh importer wizard\r\n  - Enables importing multiple mesh files into a 3D scene without having to first build an OpenSim model\r\n  - Users can then rearrange the meshes in 3D space and assign bodies/joints to them while moving things around in a global, Blender-like, coordinate system\r\n  - Once the user has set everything up in this wizard, it automatically generates an OpenSim model from the assignments\r\n  - This is work in progress. It requires further development, but may still save a significant amount of time over manually building the model step-by-step through the main editor UI\r\n- **Experimental**: You can now plot subfields of an output, rather than only being able to plot `double` value types\r\n  - Practically, this means that you can plot a `Vec3`'s `x`, `y`, or `z` coordinates\r\n  - Experimental, because the output names etc. need to be fixed when exporting the resulting (subfield) output to a CSV file\r\n", "tarball_url":

Discussions](#issues-vs-discussions)\n- [How to open an Issue](#how-to-open-an-issue)\n- [How to open a Pull Request](#how-to-open-a-pull-request)\n- [Copyright / Contributor License Agreement](#copyright--contributor-license-agreement)\n\n## Getting Started & General Advice\n\n- Article: [How To Ask Good Questions](https://bit.ly/3nwRnx1).\n- Please browse the [Wiki](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki) to find code snippets, links and other resources (e.g. [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started), [Useful extensions](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Useful-Extensions)).\n- Please read [Getting Started](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/wiki/Getting-Started) if your question relates to setting up Dear ImGui.\n- Please read [docs/FAQ.md](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- Please read [docs/FONTS.md](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/docs/FONTS.md) if your question relates to fonts or text.\n- Please run `ImGui::ShowDemoWindow()` to explore the demo and its sources.\n- Please use the search function of your IDE to search for symbols and comments related to your situation.\n- Please use the search function of GitHub to look for similar topics (always include 'Closed' issues/pr in your search).\n- You may [browse issues by Labels](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/labels).\n- Please use a web search engine to look for similar issues.\n- If you get a crash or assert, use a debugger to locate the line triggering it and read the comments around.\n- Please don't be a [Help Vampire](https://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/).\n\n## 'Issues' vs 'Discussions'\n\nWe are happy to use 'Issues' for many type of open-ended questions. We are encouraging 'Issues' becoming an enormous, centralized and cross-referenced database of Dear ImGui contents.\n\nOnly if you:\n- Cannot BUILD or LINK examples.\n- Cannot BUILD, or LINK, or RUN Dear ImGui in your application or custom engine.\n- Cannot LOAD a font.\n\nThen please [use the Discussions forums](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/discussions) instead of opening an issue.\n\nIf Dear ImGui is successfully showing in your app and you have used Dear ImGui before, you can open an Issue. Any form of discussions is welcome as a new issue.\n\n## How to open an issue\n\nYou may use the Issue Tracker to submit bug reports, feature requests or suggestions. You may ask for help or advice as well. But **PLEASE CAREFULLY READ THIS WALL OF TEXT. ISSUES IGNORING THOSE GUIDELINES MAY BE CLOSED. USERS IGNORING THOSE GUIDELINES MIGHT BE BLOCKED.**\n\nPlease do your best to clarify your request. The amount of incomplete or ambiguous requests due to people not following those guidelines is often overwhelming. Issues created without the requested information may be closed prematurely. Exceptionally entitled, impolite, or lazy requests may lead to bans.\n\n**PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE LIVES OR DIES BY THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY MAINTAINERS CAN SPARE. WE HAVE LOTS OF STUFF TO DO. THIS IS AN ATTENTION ECONOMY AND MANY LAZY OR MINOR ISSUES ARE HOGGING OUR ATTENTION AND DRAINING ENERGY, TAKING US AWAY FROM MORE IMPORTANT WORK.**\n\nSteps:\n\n- Article: [How To Ask Good Questions](https://bit.ly/3nwRnx1).\n- **PLEASE DO FILL THE REQUESTED NEW ISSUE TEMPLATE.** Including Dear ImGui version number, branch name, platform/renderer back-ends (imgui_impl_XXX files), operating system.\n- **Try to be explicit with your GOALS, your EXPECTATIONS and what you have tried**.  Be mindful of [The XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/). What you have in mind or in your code is not obvious to other people. People frequently discuss problems and suggest incorrect solutions without first clarifying their goals. When requesting a new feature, please describe the usage context (how you intend to use it, why you need it, etc.). If you tried something and it failed, show us what you tried.\n- **Please INCLUDE CODE. Provide a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable Example ([MCVE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)) to demonstrate your problem**. An ideal submission includes a small piece of code that anyone can paste into one of the examples applications (examples/../main.cpp) or demo (imgui_demo.cpp) to understand and reproduce it. **Narrowing your problem to its shortest and purest form is the easiest way to understand it, explain it and fix it**. Please test your shortened code to ensure it exhibits the problem. **Often while creating the MCVE you will solve the problem!** Many questions that are missing a standalone verifiable example are missing the actual cause of their issue in the description, which ends up wasting everyone's time.\n- **Attach screenshots (or GIF/video) to clarify the context**. They often convey useful information that is omitted by the description. You can drag pictures/files in the message edit box. Avoid using 3rd party image hosting services, prefer the long-term longevity of GitHub attachments (you can drag pictures into your post). On Windows, you can use [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/) to easily capture .gif files.\n- **If you are discussing an assert or a crash, please provide a debugger callstack**. Never state \"it crashes\" without additional information. If you don't know how to use a debugger and retrieve a callstack, learning about it will be useful.\n- **Please make sure that your project has asserts enabled.** Calls to IM_ASSERT() are scattered in the code to help catch common issues. When an assert is triggered read the comments around it. By default IM_ASSERT() calls the standard assert() function. To verify that your asserts are enabled, add the line `IM_ASSERT(false);` in your main() function. Your application should display an error message and abort. If your application doesn't report an error, your asserts are disabled.\n- Please state if you have made substantial modifications to your copy of Dear ImGui or the back-end.\n- If you are not calling Dear ImGui directly from C++, please provide information about your Language and the wrapper/binding you are using.\n- Be mindful that messages are being sent to the mailbox of \"Watching\" users. Try to proofread your messages before sending them. Edits are not seen by those users unless they browse the site.\n\n**Some unfortunate words of warning**\n- If you are involved in cheating schemes (e.g. DLL injection) for competitive online multiplayer games, please don't post here. We won't answer and you will be blocked. It doesn't matter if your question relates to said project. We've had too many of you and need to protect our time and sanity.\n- Due to frequent abuse of this service from the aforementioned users, if your GitHub account is anonymous and was created five minutes ago please understand that your post will receive more scrutiny and incomplete questions will be harshly dismissed.\n\nIf you have been using Dear ImGui for a while or have been using C/C++ for several years or have demonstrated good behavior here, it is ok to not fulfill every item to the letter. Those are guidelines and experienced users or members of the community will know which information is useful in a given context.\n\n## How to open a Pull Request\n\n- **Please understand that by submitting a PR you are also submitting a request for the maintainer to review your code and then take over its maintenance.** PR should be crafted both in the interest of the end-users and also to ease the maintainer into understanding and accepting it.\n- Many PRs are useful to demonstrate a need and a possible solution but aren't adequate for merging (causing other issues, not seeing other aspects of the big picture, etc.). In doubt, don't hesitate to push a PR because that is always the first step toward pointing toward a problem, and finding the mergeable solution! Even if a PR stays unmerged for a long time, its presence can be useful for other users and helps toward finding a general solution.\n- **When adding a feature,** please describe the usage context (how you intend to use it, why you need it, etc.). Be mindful of [The XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info/).\n- **When fixing a warning or compilation problem,** please post the compiler log and specify the compiler version and platform you are using.\n- **Attach screenshots (or GIF/video) to clarify the context and demonstrate the feature at a glance.** You can drag pictures/files in the message edit box. Prefer the long-term longevity of GitHub attachments over 3rd party hosting (you can drag pictures into your post).\n- **Make sure your code follows the coding style already used in the codebase:** 4 spaces indentations (no tabs), `local_variable`, `FunctionName()`, `MemberName`, `// Text Comment`, `//CodeComment();`, C-style casts, etc.. We don't use modern C++ idioms and tend to use only a minimum of C++11 features. The applications under examples/ are generally less consistent because they sometimes try to mimic the coding style often adopted by a certain ecosystem (e.g. DirectX-related code tend to use the style of their sample).\n- **Make sure you create a branch dedicated to the pull request**. In Git, 1 PR is associated to 1 branch. If you keep pushing to the same branch after you submitted the PR, your new commits will appear in the PR (we can still cherry-pick individual commits).\n\n## Copyright / Contributor License Agreement\n\nAny code you submit will become part of the repository and be distributed under the [Dear ImGui license](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/blob/master/LICENSE.txt). By submitting code to the project you agree that the code is your work and that you can give it to the project.\n\nYou also agree by submitting your code that you grant all transferable rights to the code to the project maintainer, including for example re-licensing the code, modifying the code, and distributing it in source or binary forms. Specifically, this includes a requirement that you assign copyright to the project maintainer. For this reason, do not modify any copyright statements in files in any PRs.\n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/main/third_party/imgui/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "If you would like to contribute to OpenSim Creator then thank you \ud83e\udd70: it's people like you\nthat make open-source awesome!

If you only\nwant to use OpenBLAS rather than make changes to it, we recommend installing a\npre-built binary package with your package manager of choice.\n\nThis page contains an overview of installing with package managers as well as\nfrom source. For the latter, see [further down on this page](#building-from-source).\n\n\n## Installing with a package manager\n\n!!! note\n    Almost every package manager provides OpenBLAS packages; the list on this\n    page is not comprehensive. If your package manager of choice isn't shown\n    here, please search its package database for `openblas` or `libopenblas`.\n\n\n### Linux\n\nOn Linux, OpenBLAS can be installed with the system package manager, or with a\npackage manager like [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)\n(or alternative package managers for the conda-forge ecosystem, like\n[Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/),\n[Micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html),\nor [Pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#windows-installer)),\n[Spack](https://spack.io/), or [Nix](https://nixos.org/). For the latter set of\ntools, the package name in all cases is `openblas`. Since package management in\nquite a few of these tools is declarative (i.e., managed by adding `openblas`\nto a metadata file describing the dependencies for your project or\nenvironment), we won't attempt to give detailed instructions for these tools here.\n\nLinux distributions typically split OpenBLAS up in two packages: one containing\nthe library itself (typically named `openblas` or `libopenblas`), and one containing headers,\npkg-config and CMake files (typically named the same as the package for the\nlibrary with `-dev` or `-devel` appended; e.g., `openblas-devel`). Please keep\nin mind that if you want to install OpenBLAS in order to use it directly in\nyour own project, you will need to install both of those packages.\n\nDistro-specific installation commands:\n\n=== \"Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Kali\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo apt update\n    $ sudo apt install libopenblas-dev\n    ```\n    OpenBLAS can be configured as the default BLAS through the `update-alternatives` mechanism:\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3\n    ```\n\n=== \"openSUSE/SLE\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo zypper refresh\n    $ sudo zypper install openblas-devel\n    ```\n\n    OpenBLAS can be configured as the default BLAS through the `update-alternatives` mechanism:\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo update-alternatives --config libblas.so.3\n    ```\n\n=== \"Fedora/CentOS/RHEL\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ dnf check-update\n    $ dnf install openblas-devel\n    ```\n\n    !!! warning\n\n        Fedora does not ship the pkg-config files for OpenBLAS. Instead, it wants you to\n        link against [FlexiBLAS](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/projects/flexiblas) (which\n        uses OpenBLAS by default as its backend on Fedora), which you can install with:\n\n        ```bash\n        $ dnf install flexiblas-devel\n        ```\n\n    For CentOS and RHEL, OpenBLAS packages are provided via the [Fedora EPEL repository](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL).\n    After adding that repository and its repository keys, you can install\n    `openblas-devel` with either `dnf` or `yum`.\n\n=== \"Arch/Manjaro/Antergos\"\n\n    ```bash\n    $ sudo pacman -S openblas\n    ```\n\n\n### Windows\n\n=== \"Conda-forge\"\n\n    OpenBLAS can be installed with `conda` (or `mamba`, `micromamba`, or\n    `pixi`) from conda-forge:\n    ```\n    conda install openblas\n    ```\n\n    Conda-forge provides a method for switching the default BLAS implementation\n    used by all packages. To use that for OpenBLAS, install `libblas=*=*openblas`\n    (see [the docs on this mechanism](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#switching-blas-implementation)\n    for more details).\n\n=== \"vcpkg\"\n\n    OpenBLAS can be installed with vcpkg:\n    ```cmd\n    # In classic mode:\n    vcpkg install openblas\n\n    # Or in manifest mode:\n    vcpkg add port openblas\n    ```\n\n=== \"OpenBLAS releases\"\n\n    Windows is the only platform for which binaries are made available by the\n    OpenBLAS project itself. They can be downloaded from the GitHub\n    Releases](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases) page. These\n    binaries are built with MinGW, using the following build options:\n    ```\n    NUM_THREADS=64 TARGET=GENERIC DYNAMIC_ARCH=1 DYNAMIC_OLDER=1 CONSISTENT_FPCSR=1 INTERFACE=0\n    ```\n    There are separate packages for x86-64 and x86. The zip archive contains\n    the include files, static and shared libraries, as well as configuration\n    files for getting them found via CMake or pkg-config. To use these\n    binaries, create a suitable folder for your OpenBLAS installation and unzip\n    the `.zip` bundle there (note that you will need to edit the provided\n    `openblas.pc` and `OpenBLASConfig.cmake` to reflect the installation path\n    on your computer, as distributed they have \"win\" or \"win64\" reflecting the\n    local paths on the system they were built on).\n\n    Note that the same binaries can be downloaded\n    [from SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/openblas/files); this is\n    mostly of historical interest.\n\n\n### macOS\n\nTo install OpenBLAS with a package manager on macOS, run:\n\n=== \"Homebrew\"\n\n    ```zsh\n    % brew install openblas\n    ```\n\n=== \"MacPorts\"\n\n    ```zsh\n    % sudo port install OpenBLAS-devel\n    ```\n\n=== \"Conda-forge\"\n\n    ```zsh\n    % conda install openblas\n    ```\n\n    Conda-forge provides a method for switching the default BLAS implementation\n    used by all packages. To use that for OpenBLAS, install `libblas=*=*openblas`\n    (see [the docs on this mechanism](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base/#switching-blas-implementation)\n    for more details).\n\n\n### FreeBSD\n\nYou can install OpenBLAS from the FreeBSD [Ports collection](https://www.freebsd.org/ports/index.html):\n```\npkg install openblas\n```\n\n\n## Building from source\n\nWe recommend download the latest [stable version](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/releases)\nfrom the GitHub Releases page, or checking it out from a git tag, rather than a\ndev version from the `develop` branch.\n\n!!! tip\n\n    The User manual contains [a section with detailed information on compiling OpenBLAS](user_manual.md#compiling-openblas),\n    including how to customize builds and how to cross-compile. Please read\n    that documentation first. This page contains only platform-specific build\n    information, and assumes you already understand the general build system\n    invocations to build OpenBLAS, with the specific build options you want to\n    control multi-threading and other non-platform-specific behavior).\n\n\n### Linux and macOS\n\nEnsure you have C and Fortran compilers installed, then simply type `make` to compile the library.\nThere are no other build dependencies, nor unusual platform-specific\nenvironment variables to set or other system setup to do.\n\n!!! note\n\n    When building in an emulator (KVM, QEMU, etc.), please make sure that the combination of CPU features exposed to\n    the virtual environment matches that of an existing CPU to allow detection of the CPU model to succeed.\n    (With `qemu`, this can be done by passing `-cpu host` or a supported model name at invocation).\n\n\n### Windows\n\nWe support building OpenBLAS with either MinGW or Visual Studio on Windows.\nUsing MSVC will yield an OpenBLAS build with the Windows platform-native ABI.\nUsing MinGW will yield a different ABI. We'll describe both methods in detail\nin this section, since the process for each is quite different.\n\n#### Visual Studio & native Windows ABI\n\nFor Visual Studio, you can use CMake to generate Visual Studio solution files;\nnote that you will need at least CMake 3.11 for linking to work correctly).\n\nNote that you need a Fortran compiler if you plan to build and use the LAPACK\nfunctions included with OpenBLAS. The sections below describe using either\n`flang` as an add-on to clang/LLVM or `gfortran` as part of MinGW for this\npurpose. If you want to use the Intel Fortran compiler (`ifort` or `ifx`) for\nthis, be sure to also use the Intel C compiler (`icc` or `icx`) for building\nthe C parts, as the ABI imposed by `ifort` is incompatible with MSVC\n\nA fully-optimized OpenBLAS that can be statically or dynamically linked to your\napplication can currently be built for the 64-bit architecture with the LLVM\ncompiler infrastructure. We're going to use [Miniconda3](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/)\nto grab all of the tools we need, since some of them are in an experimental\nstatus. Before you begin, you'll need to have Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 or\nnewer installed.\n\n1. Install Miniconda3 for 64-bit Windows using `winget install --id Anaconda.Miniconda3`,\n   or easily download from [conda.io](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).\n2. Open the \"Anaconda Command Prompt\" now available in the Start Menu, or at `%USERPROFILE%\\miniconda3\\shell\\condabin\\conda-hook.ps1`.\n3. In that command prompt window, use `cd` to change to the directory where you want to build OpenBLAS.\n4. Now install all of the tools we need:\n   ```\n   conda update -n base conda\n   conda config --add channels conda-forge\n   conda install -y cmake flang clangdev perl libflang ninja\n   ```\n5.  Still in the Anaconda Command Prompt window, activate the 64-bit MSVC environment with `vcvarsall x64`.\n    On Windows 11 with Visual Studio 2022, this would be done by invoking:\n    \n    ```shell\n    \"c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\vc\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvars64.bat\"\n    ```\n   \n    With VS2019, the command should be the same (except for the year number of course).\n    For other versions of MSVC, please check the Visual Studio documentation for\n    exactly how to invoke the `vcvars64.bat` script.\n   \n    Confirm that the environment is active by typing `link`. This should return\n    a long list of possible options for the `link` command. If it just returns\n    _\"command not found\"_ or similar, review and retype the call to `vcvars64.bat`.\n\n    !!! note\n\n        if you are working from a Visual Studio command prompt window instead\n        (so that you do not have to do the `vcvars` call), you need to invoke\n        `conda activate` so that `CONDA_PREFIX` etc. get set up correctly before\n        proceeding to step 6. Failing to do so will lead to link errors like\n        `libflangmain.lib` not getting found later in the build.\n\n6.  Now configure the project with CMake. Starting in the project directory, execute the following:\n    ```\n    set \"LIB=%CONDA_PREFIX%\\Library\\lib;%LIB%\"\n    set \"CPATH=%CONDA_PREFIX%\\Library\\include;%CPATH%\"\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake .. -G \"Ninja\" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang -DCMAKE_MT=mt -DBUILD_WITHOUT_LAPACK=no -DNOFORTRAN=0 -DDYNAMIC_ARCH=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    ```\n\n    You may want to add further options in the `cmake` command here. For\n    instance, the default only produces a static `.lib` version of the library.\n    If you would rather have a DLL, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON` above. Note that\n    this step only creates some command files and directories, the actual build\n    happens next.\n\n7.  Build the project:\n\n    ```\n    cmake --build . --config Release\n    ```\n    This step will create the OpenBLAS library in the `lib` directory, and\n    various build-time tests in the `test`, `ctest` and `openblas_utest`\n    directories. However it will not separate the header files you might need\n    for building your own programs from those used internally. To put all\n    relevant files in a more convenient arrangement, run the next step.\n\n8.  Install all relevant files created by the build:\n\n    ```\n    cmake --install . --prefix c:\\opt -v\n    ```\n    This will copy all files that are needed for building and running your own\n    programs with OpenBLAS to the given location, creating appropriate\n    subdirectories for the individual kinds of files. In the case of `C:\\opt` as\n    given above, this would be:\n\n    - `C:\\opt\\include\\openblas` for the header files, \n    - `C:\\opt\\bin` for the `libopenblas.dll` shared library,\n    - `C:\\opt\\lib` for the static library, and\n    - `C:\\opt\\share` holds various support files that enable other cmake-based\n      build scripts to find OpenBLAS automatically.\n\n\n!!! tip \"Change in complex types for Visual Studio 2017 and up\"\n\n    In newer Visual Studio versions, Microsoft has changed\n    [how it handles complex types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/complex-math-support?view=msvc-170#types-used-in-complex-math).\n    Even when using a precompiled version of OpenBLAS, you might need to define\n    `LAPACK_COMPLEX_CUSTOM` in order to define complex types properly for MSVC.\n    For example, some variant of the following might help:\n\n    ```c\n    #if defined(_MSC_VER)\n        #include <complex.h>\n        #define LAPACK_COMPLEX_CUSTOM\n        #define lapack_complex_float _Fcomplex\n        #define lapack_complex_double _Dcomplex\n    #endif\n    ```\n\n    For reference, see\n    [openblas#3661](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/3661),\n    [lapack#683](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/683), and\n    [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47520244/using-openblas-lapacke-in-visual-studio).\n\n\n!!! warning \"Building 32-bit binaries with MSVC\"\n\n    This method may produce binaries which demonstrate significantly lower\n    performance than those built with the other methods. The Visual Studio\n    compiler does not support the dialect of assembly used in the cpu-specific\n    optimized files, so only the \"generic\" `TARGET` which is written in pure C\n    will get built. For the same reason it is not possible (and not necessary)\n    to use `-DDYNAMIC_ARCH=ON` in a Visual Studio build. You may consider\n    building for the 32-bit architecture using the GNU (MinGW) ABI instead.\n\n##### CMake & Visual Studio integration\n\nTo generate Visual Studio solution files, ensure CMake is installed and then run:\n```\n# Do this from Powershell so cmake can find visual studio\ncmake -G \"Visual Studio 14 Win64\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .\n```\n\nTo then build OpenBLAS using those solution files from within Visual Studio, we\nalso need Perl. Please install it and ensure it's on the `PATH` (see, e.g.,\n[this Stack Overflow question for how](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3051049/active-perl-installation-on-windows-operating-system)).\n\nIf you build from within Visual Studio, the dependencies may not be\nautomatically configured: if you try to build `libopenblas` directly, it may\nfail with a message saying that some `.obj` files aren't found. If this\nhappens, you can work around the problem by building the projects that\n`libopenblas` depends on before building `libopenblas` itself.\n\n###### Build OpenBLAS for Universal Windows Platform\n\nOpenBLAS can be built targeting [Universal Windows Platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Windows_Platform)\n(UWP) like this:\n\n1.  Follow the steps above to build the Visual Studio solution files for\n    Windows. This builds the helper executables which are required when building\n    the OpenBLAS Visual Studio solution files for UWP in step 2.\n2.  Remove the generated `CMakeCache.txt` and the `CMakeFiles` directory from\n    the OpenBLAS source directory, then re-run CMake with the following options:\n\n    ```\n    # do this to build UWP compatible solution files\n    cmake -G \"Visual Studio 14 Win64\" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=WindowsStore -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=\"10.0\" -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR=AMD64 -DVS_WINRT_COMPONENT=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .\n    ```\n3.  Now build the solution with Visual Studio.\n\n\n#### MinGW & GNU ABI\n\n!!! note\n\n    The resulting library from building with MinGW as described below can be\n    used in Visual Studio, but it can only be linked dynamically. This\n    configuration has not been thoroughly tested and should be considered\n    experimental.\n\n\nTo build OpenBLAS on Windows with MinGW:\n\n1.  Install the MinGW (GCC) compiler suite, either the 32-bit\n    [MinGW]((http://www.mingw.org/) or the 64-bit\n    [MinGW-w64](http://mingw-w64.sourceforge.net/) toolchain. Be sure to install\n    its `gfortran` package as well (unless you really want to build the BLAS part\n    of OpenBLAS only) and check that `gcc` and `gfortran` are the same version.\n    In addition, please install MSYS2 with MinGW.\n2.  Build OpenBLAS in the MSYS2 shell. Usually, you can just type `make`.\n    OpenBLAS will detect the compiler and CPU automatically. \n3.  After the build is complete, OpenBLAS will generate the static library\n    `libopenblas.a` and the shared library `libopenblas.dll` in the folder. You\n    can type `make PREFIX=/your/installation/path install` to install the\n    library to a certain location.\n\nNote that OpenBLAS will generate the import library `libopenblas.dll.a` for\n`libopenblas.dll` by default.\n\nIf you want to generate Windows-native PDB files from a MinGW build, you can\nuse the [cv2pdb](https://github.com/rainers/cv2pdb) tool to do so.\n\nTo then use the built OpenBLAS shared library in Visual Studio:\n\n1.  Copy the import library (`OPENBLAS_TOP_DIR/libopenblas.dll.a`) and the\n    shared library (`libopenblas.dll`) into the same folder (this must be the\n    folder of your project that is going to use the BLAS library. You may need\n    to add `libopenblas.dll.a` to the linker input list: `properties->Linker->Input`).\n2.  Please follow the Visual Studio documentation about using third-party .dll\n    libraries, and make sure to link against a library for the correct\n    architecture.[^1]\n3.  If you need CBLAS, you should include `cblas.h` in\n    `/your/installation/path/include` in Visual Studio. Please see\n    [openblas#95](http://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/issues/95) for more details.\n\n[^1]:\n   If the OpenBLAS DLLs are not linked correctly, you may see an error like\n   _\"The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b)\"_, which typically\n   indicates a mismatch between 32-bit and 64-bit libraries.\n\n!!! info \"Limitations of using the MinGW build within Visual Studio\"\n\n    - Both static and dynamic linking are supported with MinGW.  With Visual\n      Studio, however, only dynamic linking is supported and so you should use\n      the import library.\n    - Debugging from Visual Studio does not work because MinGW and Visual\n      Studio have incompatible formats for debug information (PDB vs.\n      DWARF/STABS).  You should either debug with GDB on the command line or\n      with a visual frontend, for instance [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/) or\n      [Qt Creator](http://qt.nokia.com/products/developer-tools/).\n\n\n### Windows on Arm\n\nA fully functional native OpenBLAS for WoA that can be built as both a static and dynamic library using LLVM toolchain and Visual Studio 2022. Before starting to build, make sure that you have installed Visual Studio 2022 on your ARM device, including the \"Desktop Development with C++\" component (that contains the cmake tool).\n(Note that you can use the free \"Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition\" for this task. In principle it would be possible to build with VisualStudio alone, but using\nthe LLVM toolchain enables native compilation of the Fortran sources of LAPACK and of all the optimized assembly files, which VisualStudio cannot handle on its own)\n\n1. Clone OpenBLAS to your local machine and checkout to latest release of\n   OpenBLAS (unless you want to build the latest development snapshot - here we\n   are using  the 0.3.28 release as the example, of course this exact version\n   may be outdated by the time you read this)\n  \n       ```cmd\n       git clone https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS.git\n       cd OpenBLAS\n       git checkout v0.3.28\n       ```\n  \n2. Install Latest LLVM toolchain for WoA:\n\n       Download the Latest LLVM toolchain for WoA from [the Release\n       page](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-19.1.5). At\n       the time of writing, this is version 19.1.5 - be sure to select the\n       latest release for which you can find a precompiled package whose name ends\n       in \"-woa64.exe\" (precompiled packages usually lag a week or two behind their\n       corresponding source release).  Make sure to enable the option\n       *\u201cAdd LLVM to the system PATH for all the users\u201d*.\n\n       Note: Make sure that the path of LLVM toolchain is at the top of Environment\n       Variables section to avoid conflicts between the set of compilers available\n       in the system path\n\n3. Launch the Native Command Prompt for Windows ARM64:\n\n       From the start menu search for *\"ARM64 Native Tools Command Prompt for Visual\n       Studio 2022\"*. Alternatively open command prompt, run the following command to\n       activate the environment:\n\n       ```cmd\n       C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2022\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsarm64.bat\n       ```\n\n4. Navigate to the OpenBLAS source code directory and start building OpenBLAS\n   by invoking Ninja:\n\n       ```cmd\n       cd OpenBLAS\n       mkdir build\n       cd build\n\n       cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTARGET=ARMV8 -DBINARY=64 -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang-cl -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=flang-new\n\n       ninja -j16\n       ```\n       \n       Note: You might want to include additional options in the cmake command\n       here. For example, the default configuration only generates a\n       `static.lib` version of the library. If you prefer a DLL, you can add\n       `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`.\n\n       Note that it is also possible to use the same setup to build OpenBLAS\n       with Make, if you prefer Makefiles over the CMake build for some\n       reason:\n\n       ```cmd\n       $ make CC=clang-cl FC=flang-new AR=\"llvm-ar\" TARGET=ARMV8 ARCH=arm64 RANLIB=\"llvm-ranlib\" MAKE=make\n       ```\n\n\n#### Generating an import library\n\nMicrosoft Windows has this thing called \"import libraries\". You need it for\nMSVC; you don't need it for MinGW because the `ld` linker is smart enough -\nhowever, you may still want it for some reason, so we'll describe the process\nfor both MSVC and MinGW.\n\nImport libraries are compiled from a list of what symbols to use, which are\ncontained in a `.def` file. A `.def` file should be already be present in the\n`exports` directory under the top-level OpenBLAS directory after you've run a build.\nIn your shell, move to this directory: `cd exports`.\n\n=== \"MSVC\"\n\n    Unlike MinGW, MSVC absolutely requires an import library. Now the C ABI of\n    MSVC and MinGW are actually identical, so linking is actually okay (any\n    incompatibility in the C ABI would be a bug).\n\n    The import libraries of MSVC have the suffix `.lib`. They are generated\n    from a `.def` file using MSVC's `lib.exe`.\n\n=== \"MinGW\"\n\n    MinGW import libraries have the suffix `.a`, just like static libraries.\n    Our goal is to produce the file `libopenblas.dll.a`.\n\n    You need to first insert a line `LIBRARY libopenblas.dll` in `libopenblas.def`:\n    ```\n    cat <(echo \"LIBRARY libopenblas.dll\") libopenblas.def > libopenblas.def.1\n    mv libopenblas.def.1 libopenblas.def\n    ```\n\n    Now the `.def` file probably looks like:\n    ```\n    LIBRARY libopenblas.dll\n    EXPORTS\n\t   caxpy=caxpy_  @1\n\t   caxpy_=caxpy_  @2\n           ...\n    ```\n    Then, generate the import library: `dlltool -d libopenblas.def -l libopenblas.dll.a`\n\n    _Again, there is basically **no point** in making an import library for use in MinGW. It actually slows down linking._\n\n\n### Android\n\nTo build OpenBLAS for Android, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:\n\n- [The Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/)\n- Clang compiler on the build machine\n\nThe next two sections below describe how to build with Clang for ARMV7 and\nARMV8 targets, respectively. The same basic principles as described below for\nARMV8 should also apply to building an x86 or x86-64 version (substitute\nsomething like `NEHALEM` for the target instead of `ARMV8`, and replace all the\n`aarch64` in the toolchain paths with `x86` or `x96_64` as appropriate).\n\n!!! info \"Historic note\"\n\n    Since NDK version 19, the default toolchain is provided as a standalone\n    toolchain, so building one yourself following\n    [building a standalone toolchain](http://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain.html)\n    should no longer be necessary.\n\n\n#### Building for ARMV7\n\n```bash\n# Set path to ndk-bundle\nexport NDK_BUNDLE_DIR=/path/to/ndk-bundle\n\n# Set the PATH to contain paths to clang and arm-linux-androideabi-* utilities\nexport PATH=${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH\n\n# Set LDFLAGS so that the linker finds the appropriate libgcc\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib/gcc/arm-linux-androideabi/4.9.x\"\n\n# Set the clang cross compile flags\nexport CLANG_FLAGS=\"-target arm-linux-androideabi -marm -mfpu=vfp -mfloat-abi=softfp --sysroot ${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/platforms/android-23/arch-arm -gcc-toolchain ${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/\"\n\n#OpenBLAS Compile\nmake TARGET=ARMV7 ONLY_CBLAS=1 AR=ar CC=\"clang ${CLANG_FLAGS}\" HOSTCC=gcc ARM_SOFTFP_ABI=1 -j4\n```\n\nOn macOS, it may also be necessary to give the complete path to the `ar`\nutility in the make command above, like so:\n```bash\nAR=${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/arm-linux-androideabi-4.9/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-gcc-ar\n```\notherwise you may get a linker error complaining like `malformed archive header\nname at 8` when the native macOS `ar` command was invoked instead. Note that\nwith recent NDK versions, the AR tool may be named `llvm-ar` rather than what\nis assumed above.\n\n \n#### Building for ARMV8\n\n```bash\n# Set path to ndk-bundle\nexport NDK_BUNDLE_DIR=/path/to/ndk-bundle/\n\n# Export PATH to contain directories of clang and aarch64-linux-android-* utilities\nexport PATH=${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/:${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH\n\n# Setup LDFLAGS so that loader can find libgcc and pass -lm for sqrt\nexport LDFLAGS=\"-L${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/lib/gcc/aarch64-linux-android/4.9.x -lm\"\n\n# Setup the clang cross compile options\nexport CLANG_FLAGS=\"-target aarch64-linux-android --sysroot ${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/platforms/android-23/arch-arm64 -gcc-toolchain ${NDK_BUNDLE_DIR}/toolchains/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/\"\n\n# Compile\nmake TARGET=ARMV8 ONLY_CBLAS=1 AR=ar CC=\"clang ${CLANG_FLAGS}\" HOSTCC=gcc -j4\n```\nNote: using `TARGET=CORTEXA57` in place of `ARMV8` will pick up better\noptimized routines. Implementations for the `CORTEXA57` target are compatible\nwith all other `ARMV8` targets.\n\nNote: for NDK 23b, something as simple as:\n```bash\nexport PATH=/opt/android-ndk-r23b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/:$PATH\nmake HOSTCC=gcc CC=/opt/android-ndk-r23b/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin/aarch64-linux-android31-clang ONLY_CBLAS=1 TARGET=ARMV8\n```\nappears to be sufficient on Linux. On OSX, setting AR to the ar provided in the\n\"bin\" path of the NDK (probably `llvm-ar`) is also necessary.\n\n\n??? note \"Alternative build script for 3 architectures\"\n\n    This script will build OpenBLAS for 3 architecture (`ARMV7`, `ARMV8`,\n    `X86`) and install them to `/opt/OpenBLAS/lib`. Of course you can also copy\n    only the section that is of interest to you - also notice that the `AR=`\n    line may need adapting to the name of the ar tool provided in your\n    `$TOOLCHAIN/bin` - for example `llvm-ar` in some recent NDK versions.\n    It was tested on macOS with NDK version 21.3.6528147.\n\n    ```bash\n    export NDK=YOUR_PATH_TO_SDK/Android/sdk/ndk/21.3.6528147\n    export TOOLCHAIN=$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/darwin-x86_64\n\n    make clean\n    make \\\n        TARGET=ARMV7 \\\n        ONLY_CBLAS=1 \\\n        CC=\"$TOOLCHAIN\"/bin/armv7a-linux-androideabi21-clang \\\n        AR=\"$TOOLCHAIN\"/bin/arm-linux-androideabi-ar \\\n        HOSTCC=gcc \\\n        ARM_SOFTFP_ABI=1 \\\n        -j4\n    sudo make install\n\n    make clean\n    make \\\n        TARGET=CORTEXA57 \\\n        ONLY_CBLAS=1 \\\n        CC=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android21-clang \\\n        AR=$TOOLCHAIN/bin/aarch64-linux-android-ar \\\n        HOSTCC=gcc \\\n    -j4\n    sudo make install\n\n    make clean\n    make \\\n        TARGET=ATOM \\\n        ONLY_CBLAS=1 \\\n    CC=\"$TOOLCHAIN\"/bin/i686-linux-android21-clang \\\n    AR=\"$TOOLCHAIN\"/bin/i686-linux-android-ar \\\n    HOSTCC=gcc \\\n    ARM_SOFTFP_ABI=1 \\\n    -j4\n    sudo make install\n\n    ## This will build for x86_64 \n    make clean\n    make \\\n        TARGET=ATOM BINARY=64\\\n    ONLY_CBLAS=1 \\\n    CC=\"$TOOLCHAIN\"/bin/x86_64-linux-android21-clang \\\n    AR=\"$TOOLCHAIN\"/bin/x86_64-linux-android-ar \\\n    HOSTCC=gcc \\\n    ARM_SOFTFP_ABI=1 \\\n    -j4\n    sudo make install\n    ```\n    You can find full list of target architectures in [TargetList.txt](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS/blob/develop/TargetList.txt)\n\n\n### iPhone/iOS\n\nAs none of the current developers uses iOS, the following instructions are what\nwas found to work in our Azure CI setup, but as far as we know this builds a\nfully working OpenBLAS for this platform.\n\nGo to the directory where you unpacked OpenBLAS,and enter the following commands:\n```bash\nCC=/Applications/Xcode_12.4.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/clang\n\nCFLAGS= -O2 -Wno-macro-redefined -isysroot /Applications/Xcode_12.4.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS14.4.sdk -arch arm64 -miphoneos-version-min=10.0\n\nmake TARGET=ARMV8 DYNAMIC_ARCH=1 NUM_THREADS=32 HOSTCC=clang NOFORTRAN=1\n```\nAdjust `MIN_IOS_VERSION` as necessary for your installation. E.g., change the version number\nto the minimum iOS version you want to target and execute this file to build the library.\n\n### HarmonyOS\n\nFor this target you will need the cross-compiler toolchain package by Huawei,\nwhich contains solutions for both Windows and Linux. Only the Linux-based\ntoolchain has been tested so far, but the following instructions may apply\nsimilarly to Windows:\n\nDownload [this HarmonyOS 4.1.1 SDK](https://repo.huaweicloud.com/harmonyos/os/4.1.1-Release/ohos-sdk-windows_linux-public.tar.gz),\nor whatever newer version may be available in the future). Use `tar -xvf\nohos-sdk-windows_linux_public.tar.gz` to unpack it somewhere on your system.\nThis will create a folder named \"ohos-sdk\" with subfolders \"linux\" and\n\"windows\". In the linux one you will find a ZIP archive named\n`native-linux-x64-4.1.7.8-Release.zip` - you need to unzip this where you want\nto install the cross-compiler, for example in `/opt/ohos-sdk`.\n\nIn the directory where you unpacked OpenBLAS, create a build directory for cmake, and change into it :\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\n```\nUse the version of `cmake` that came with the SDK, and specify the location of\nits toolchain file as a cmake option. Also set the build target for OpenBLAS to\n`ARMV8` and specify `NOFORTRAN=1` (at least as of version 4.1.1, the SDK\ncontains no Fortran compiler):\n```bash\n/opt/ohos-sdk/linux/native/build-tools/cmake/bin/cmake \\\n      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/opt/ohos-sdk/linux/native/build/cmake/ohos.toolchain.cmake \\\n      -DOHOS_ARCH=\"arm64-v8a\" -DTARGET=ARMV8 -DNOFORTRAN=1 ..\n```\nAdditional other OpenBLAS build options like `USE_OPENMP=1` or `DYNAMIC_ARCH=1`\nwill probably work too. Finally do the build:\n```bash\n/opt/ohos-sdk/linux/native/build-tools/cmake/bin/cmake --build .\n```\n\n### MIPS\n\nFor MIPS targets you will need latest toolchains:\n\n- P5600 - MTI GNU/Linux Toolchain\n- I6400, P6600 - IMG GNU/Linux Toolchain\n\nYou can use following commandlines for builds:\n\n```bash\nIMG_TOOLCHAIN_DIR={full IMG GNU/Linux Toolchain path including \"bin\" directory -- for example, /opt/linux_toolchain/bin}\nIMG_GCC_PREFIX=mips-img-linux-gnu\nIMG_TOOLCHAIN=${IMG_TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/${IMG_GCC_PREFIX}\n\n# I6400 Build (n32):\nmake BINARY=32 BINARY32=1 CC=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gcc AR=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ar FC=\"$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gfortran -EL -mabi=n32\" RANLIB=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ranlib HOSTCC=gcc CFLAGS=\"-EL\" FFLAGS=$CFLAGS LDFLAGS=$CFLAGS TARGET=I6400\n\n# I6400 Build (n64):\nmake BINARY=64 BINARY64=1 CC=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gcc AR=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ar FC=\"$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gfortran -EL\" RANLIB=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ranlib HOSTCC=gcc CFLAGS=\"-EL\" FFLAGS=$CFLAGS LDFLAGS=$CFLAGS TARGET=I6400\n\n# P6600 Build (n32):\nmake BINARY=32 BINARY32=1 CC=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gcc AR=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ar FC=\"$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gfortran -EL -mabi=n32\" RANLIB=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ranlib HOSTCC=gcc CFLAGS=\"-EL\" FFLAGS=$CFLAGS LDFLAGS=$CFLAGS TARGET=P6600\n\n# P6600 Build (n64):\nmake BINARY=64 BINARY64=1 CC=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gcc AR=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ar FC=\"$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-gfortran -EL\" RANLIB=$IMG_TOOLCHAIN-ranlib HOSTCC=gcc CFLAGS=\"-EL\" FFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS\" LDFLAGS=\"$CFLAGS\" TARGET=P6600\n\nMTI_TOOLCHAIN_DIR={full MTI GNU/Linux Toolchain path including \"bin\" directory -- for example, /opt/linux_toolchain/bin}\nMTI_GCC_PREFIX=mips-mti-linux-gnu\nMTI_TOOLCHAIN=${IMG_TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/${IMG_GCC_PREFIX}\n\n# P5600 Build:\n\nmake BINARY=32 BINARY32=1 CC=$MTI_TOOLCHAIN-gcc AR=$MTI_TOOLCHAIN-ar FC=\"$MTI_TOOLCHAIN-gfortran -EL\"    RANLIB=$MTI_TOOLCHAIN-ranlib HOSTCC=gcc CFLAGS=\"-EL\" FFLAGS=$CFLAGS LDFLAGS=$CFLAGS TARGET=P5600\n```\n\n\n### FreeBSD\n\nYou will need to install the following tools from the FreeBSD ports tree:\n\n* lang/gcc\n* lang/perl5.12\n* ftp/curl\n* devel/gmake\n* devel/patch\n\nTo compile run the command:\n```bash\n$ gmake CC=gcc FC=gfortran\n```\n\n\n### Cortex-M\n\nCortex-M is a widely used microcontroller that is present in a variety of\nindustrial and consumer electronics. A common variant of the Cortex-M is the\n`STM32F4xx` series. Here, we will give instructions for building for that\nseries.\n\nFirst, install the embedded Arm GCC compiler from the Arm website. Then, create\nthe following `toolchain.cmake` file:\n\n```cmake\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)\n\nset(CMAKE_C_COMPILER \"arm-none-eabi-gcc.exe\")\nset(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER \"arm-none-eabi-g++.exe\")\n\nset(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS \"--specs=nosys.specs\" CACHE INTERNAL \"\")\n\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)\nset(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)\n```\n\nThen build OpenBLAS with:\n```bash\n$ cmake .. -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=arm-none-eabi-gcc -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:PATH=\"toolchain.cmake\" -DNOFORTRAN=1 -DTARGET=ARMV5 -DEMBEDDED=1\n```\n\nIn your embedded application, the following functions need to be provided for OpenBLAS to work correctly:\n```C\nvoid free(void* ptr);\nvoid* malloc(size_t size);\n```\n\n!!! note\n\n    If you are developing for an embedded platform, it is your responsibility\n    to make sure that the device has sufficient memory for `malloc` calls.\n    [Libmemory](https://github.com/embeddedartistry/libmemory)\n    provides one implementation of `malloc` for embedded platforms.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComputationalBiomechanicsLab/opensim-creator/main/third_party/OpenBLAS/docs/install.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# To build and use SDL:\n\nSDL supports a number of development environments:\n- [CMake](docs/INTRO-cmake.md)\n- [Visual Studio on Windows](docs/INTRO-visualstudio.md)\n- [gcc on Windows](docs/INTRO-mingw.md)\n- [Xcode on Apple platforms](docs/INTRO-xcode.md)\n- [Android Studio](docs/INTRO-androidstudio.md)\n- [Emscripten for web](docs/INTRO-emscripten.md)\n\nSDL is also usable in other environments.
