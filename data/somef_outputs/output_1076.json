By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.

Required for the trace to make sense in #1107.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Repair reference to custom HPC resources in the `\"future\"` backend (#1083, @jennysjaarda).\r\n- Properly copy data when importing targets from one cache into another (#1120, @brendanf).\r\n- Prevent dynamic vector sizes from conflicting with file sizes in metadata.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Add a new `log_build_times` argument to `make()` and `drake_config()`. Allows users to disable the recording of build times. Produces a speedup of up to 20% on Macs (#1078).\r\n- Implement cache locking to prohibit concurrent calls to `make()`, `outdated(make_imports = TRUE)`, `recoverable(make_imports = TRUE)`, `vis_drake_graph(make_imports = TRUE)`, `clean()`, etc. on the same cache.\r\n- Add a new `format` trigger to invalidate targets when the specialized data format changes (#1104, @kendonB).\r\n- Add new functions `cache_planned()` and `cache_unplanned()` to help selectively clean workflows with dynamic targets (#1110, @kendonB).\r\n- Add S3 classes and pretty print methods for `drake_config()` objects and `analyze_code()` objects.\r\n- Add a new `\"qs\"` format (#1121, @kendonB).\r\n\r\n## Speedups\r\n\r\n- Avoid setting seeds for imports (#1086, @adamkski).\r\n- Avoid working directly with POSIXct times (#1086, @adamkski)\r\n- Avoid excessive calls to `%||%` (`%|||%` is faster).

Also remove all links from the news and vignette. The links trigger too many CRAN notes, which made the automated checks too brittle.\r\n- Serialize formats that need serialization (like \"keras\") before sending the data from HPC workers to the master process (#989).\r\n- Check for custom-formatted files when checking checksums.\r\n- Force fst-formatted targets to plain data frames. Same goes for the new \"fst_dt\" format.\r\n- Change the meaning and behavior of `max_expand` in `drake_plan()`. `max_expand` is now the maximum number of targets produced by `map()`, `split()`, and `cross()`. For `cross()`, this reduces the number of targets (less cumbersome) and makes the subsample of targets more representative of the complete grid. It also. ensures consistent target naming when `.id` is `FALSE` (#1002). Note: `max_expand` is not for production workflows anyway, so this change does not break anything important. Unfortunately, we do lose the speed boost in `drake_plan()` originally due to `max_expand`, but `drake_plan()` is still fast, so that is not so bad.\r\n- Drop specialized formats of `NULL` targets (#998).\r\n- Prevent false grouping variables from partially tagging along in `cross()` (#1009). The same fix should apply to `map()` and `split()` too.\r\n- Respect graph topology when recovering old grouping variables for `map()` (#1010).\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Add a new \"fst_dt\" format for `fst`-powered saving of `data.table` objects.\r\n- Support a custom \"caching\" column of the plan to select master vs worker caching for each target individually (#988).\r\n- Make `transform` a formal argument of `target()` so that users do not have to type \"transform =\" all the time in `drake_plan()` (#993).\r\n- Migrate the documentation website from `ropensci.github.io/drake` to `docs.ropensci.org/drake`.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Document the HPC limitations of `target(format = \"keras\")` (#989).\r\n- Remove the now-superfluous vignette.\r\n- Wrap up console and text file logging functionality into a reference class (#964).\r\n- Deprecate the `verbose` argument in various caching functions. The location of the cache is now only printed in `make()`.

This allows users to leverage faster ways to save and load targets, such as `write_fst()` for data frames and `save_model_hdf5()` for Keras models. It also improves memory because it prevents `storr` from making a serialized in-memory copy of large data objects.**\r\n- Add `tidyselect` functionality for `...` in `progress()`, analogous to `loadd()`, `build_times()`, and `clean()`.\r\n- Support S3 for user-defined generics (#959). If the generic `do_stuff()` and the method `stuff.your_class()` are defined in `envir`, and if `do_stuff()` has a call to `UseMethod(\"stuff\")`, then `drake`'s code analysis will detect `stuff.your_class()` as a dependency of `do_stuff()`.\r\n- Add authentication support for `file_in()` URLs. Requires the new `curl_handles` argument of `make()` and `drake_config()` (#981).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Make `drake_plan(transform = slice())` understand `.id` and grouping variables (#963).\r\n- Repair `clean(garbage_collection = TRUE, destroy = TRUE)`. Previously it destroyed the cache before trying to collect garbage.\r\n- Ensure that `r_make()` passes informative error messages back to the calling process (#969).\r\n- Avoid downloading full contents of URLs when rehashing (#982)\r\n- Retain upstream grouping variables of `map()` and `cross()` on topologically side-by-side targets (#983).\r\n- Manually enforce the correct ordering in `dsl_left_outer_join()` so `cross()` selects the right combinations of existing targets (#986). This bug was probably introduced in the solution to #983.\r\n- Make the output of `progress()` more consistent, less dependent on whether `tidyselect` is installed.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Document DSL keywords as if they were true functions: `target()`, `map()`, `split()`, `cross()`, and `combine()` (#979).\r\n- Do garbage collection between the unloading and loading phases of memory management.\r\n- Keep `file_out()` files in `clean()` unless `garbage_collection` is `TRUE`. That way, `make(recover = TRUE)` is a true \"undo button\" for `clean()`. `clean(garbage_collection = TRUE)` still removes data in the cache, as well as any `file_out()` files from targets currently being cleaned.\r\n- The menu in `clean()` only appears if `garbage_collection` is `TRUE`. Also, this menu is added to `rescue_cache(garbage_collection = TRUE)`.\r\n- Reorganize the internal code files and functions to make development easier.\r\n- Move the history inside the cache folder `.drake/`. The old `.drake_history/` folder was awkward. Old histories are migrated during `drake_config()`, and `drake_history()`.\r\n- Add lifecycle badges to exported functions.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v7.6.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v7.6.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v7.6.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/19356311", "release_id": 19356311, "date_created": "2019-08-17T16:43:35Z", "date_published": "2019-08-17T16:46:47Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/18757244", "tag": "v7.5.2", "name": "CRAN hotfix", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "- Eliminate accidental creations of `.drake_history/` in `plan_to_code()`, `plan_to_notebook()`, and the help file examples.

This makes sure `config$envir` is correctly locked in `make(parallelism = \"clustermq\")`.\r\n- Convert factors to characters in the optional `.data` argument of `map()` and `cross()` in the DSL.\r\n- In the DSL of `drake_plan()`, repair `cross(.data = !!args)`, where `args` is an optional data frame of grouping variables.\r\n- Handle trailing slashes in `file_in()`/`file_out()` directories for Windows ([#855](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/855)).\r\n- Make `.id_chr` work with `combine()` in the DSL ([#867](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/867)).\r\n- Do not try `make_spinner()` unless the version of `cli` is at least 1.1.0.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Add functions `text_drake_graph()` (and `r_text_drake_graph()` and `render_text_drake_graph()`). Uses text art to print a dependency graph to the terminal window. Handy for when users SSH into remote machines without X Window support.\r\n- Add a new `max_expand` argument to `drake_plan()`, an optional upper bound on the lengths of grouping variables for `map()` and `cross()` in the DSL. Comes in handy when you have a massive number of targets and you want to test on a miniature version of your workflow before you scale up to production.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Delay the initialization of `clustermq` workers for as long as possible. Before launching them, build/check targets locally until we reach an outdated target with `hpc` equal to `FALSE`. In other words, if no targets actually require `clustermq` workers, no workers get created.\r\n- In `make(parallelism = \"future\")`, reset the `config$sleep()` backoff interval whenever a new target gets checked.\r\n- Add a \"done\" message to the console log file when the workflow has completed.\r\n- Replace `CodeDepends` with a base R solution in `code_to_plan()`. Fixes a CRAN note.\r\n- The DSL (transformations in `drake_plan()`) is no longer experimental.\r\n- The `callr` API (`r_make()` and friends) is no longer experimental.\r\n- Deprecate the wildcard/text-based functions for creating plans: `evaluate_plan()`, `expand_plan()`, `map_plan()`, `gather_plan()`, `gather_by()`, `reduce_plan()`, `reduce_by()`. \r\n- Change some deprecated functions to defunct: `deps()`, `max_useful_jobs()`, and `migrate_drake_project()`.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v7.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v7.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v7.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/17448098", "release_id": 17448098, "date_created": "2019-05-19T15:22:11Z", "date_published": "2019-05-19T15:24:07Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/16862641", "tag": "v7.2.0", "name": "Improved visuals", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# Version 7.2.0\r\n\r\n`drake` version 7.2.0 is being released early in order to ensure compatibility with development `testthat`, re https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/849.\r\n\r\n## Mildly breaking changes\r\n\r\n- In the DSL (e.g. `drake_plan(x = target(..., transform = map(...)))` avoid inserting extra dots in target names when the grouping variables are character vectors ([#847](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/847)). Target names come out much nicer this way, but those name changes will invalidate some targets (i.e. they need to be rebuilt with `make()`).\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Use `config$jobs_preprocess` (local jobs) in several places where `drake` was incorrectly using `config$jobs` (meant for targets).\r\n- Allow `loadd(x, deps = TRUE, config = your_config)` to work even if `x` is not cached ([#830](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/830)). Required disabling `tidyselect` functionality when `deps` `TRUE`. There is a new note in the help file about this, and an informative console message prints out on `loadd(deps = TRUE, tidyselect = TRUE)`. The default value of `tidyselect` is now `!deps`.\r\n- Minor: avoid printing messages and warnings twice to the console ([#829](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/829)).\r\n- Ensure compatibility with `testthat` >= 2.0.1.9000.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- In `drake_plan()` transformations, allow the user to refer to a target's own name using a special `.id_chr` symbol, which is treated like a character string.\r\n- Add a `transparency` argument to `drake_ggraph()` and `render_drake_ggraph()` to disable transparency in the rendered graph. Useful for R installations without transparency support.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Use a custom layout to improve node positions and aspect ratios of `vis_drake_graph()` and `drake_ggraph()` displays. Only activated in `vis_drake_graph()` when there are at least 10 nodes distributed in both the vertical and horizontal directions.\r\n- Allow nodes to be dragged both vertically and horizontally in `vis_drake_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()`.\r\n- Prevent dots from showing up in target names when you supply grouping variables to transforms in `drake_plan()` ([#847](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/847)).\r\n- Do not keep `drake` plans (`drake_plan()`) inside `drake_config()` objects. When other bottlenecks are removed, this will reduce the burden on memory (re [#800](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/800)).\r\n- Do not retain the `targets` argument inside `drake_config()` objects. This is to reduce memory consumption.\r\n- Deprecate the `layout` and `direction` arguments of `vis_drake_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()`. Direction is now always left to right and the layout is always Sugiyama.\r\n- Write the cache log file in CSV format (now `drake_cache.csv` by default) to avoid issues with spaces (e.g. entry names with spaces in them, such as \"file report.Rmd\")`.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v7.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v7.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v7.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/16862641", "release_id": 16862641, "date_created": "2019-04-19T02:37:11Z", "date_published": "2019-04-19T02:43:01Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/16604799", "tag": "v7.1.0", "name": "Maintenance release", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# Version 7.1.0\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- In `drake` 7.0.0, if you run `make()` in interactive mode and respond to the menu prompt with an option other than `1` or `2`, targets will still build. \r\n- Make sure file outputs show up in `drake_graph()`. The bug came from `append_output_file_nodes()`, a utility function of `drake_graph_info()`.\r\n- Repair `r_make(r_fn = callr::r_bg())` re https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/799.\r\n- Allow `drake_ggraph()` and `sankey_drake_graph()` to work when the graph has no edges.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Add a new `use_drake()` function to write the `make.R` and `_drake.R` files from the [main example](https://github.com/wlandau/drake-examples/tree/master/main). Does not write other supporting scripts.\r\n- With an optional logical `hpc` column in your `drake_plan()`, you can now select which targets to deploy to HPC and which to run locally.\r\n- Add a `list` argument to `build_times()`, just like `loadd()`.\r\n- Add a new RStudio addin: 'loadd target at cursor' which can be bound a keyboard shortcut to load the target identified by the symbol at the cursor position to the global environment.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- `file_in()` and `file_out()` can now handle entire directories, e.g. `file_in(\"your_folder_of_input_data_files\")` and `file_out(\"directory_with_a_bunch_of_output_files\")`.\r\n- Send less data from `config` to HPC workers.\r\n- Improve `drake_ggraph()`\r\n  - Hide node labels by default and render the arrows behind the nodes.\r\n  - Print an informative error message when the user supplies a `drake` plan to the `config` argument of a function.\r\n  - By default, use gray arrows and a black-and-white background with no gridlines.\r\n- For the `map()` and `cross()` transformations in the DSL, prevent the [accidental sorting of targets by name](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/786). Needed `merge(sort = FALSE)` in `dsl_left_outer_join()`.\r\n- Simplify verbosity. The `verbose` argument of `make()` now takes values 0, 1, and 2, and maximum verbosity in the console prints targets, retries, failures, and a spinner. The console log file, on the other hand, dumps maximally verbose runtime info regardless of the `verbose` argument.\r\n- In previous versions, functions generated with `f <- Rcpp::cppFunction(...)` did not stay up to date from session to session because the addresses corresponding to anonymous pointers were showing up in `deparse(f)`. Now, `drake` ignores those pointers, and `Rcpp` functions compiled inline appear to stay up to date. This problem was more of an edge case than a bug.\r\n- Prepend time stamps with sub-second times to the lines of the console log file.\r\n- In `drake_plan()`, deprecate the `tidy_evaluation` argument in favor of the new and more concise `tidy_eval`. To preserve back compatibility for now, if you supply a non-`NULL` value to `tidy_evaluation`, it overwrites `tidy_eval`.\r\n- Reduce the object size of `drake_config()` objects by assigning closure of `config$sleep` to `baseenv()`.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v7.1.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v7.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v7.1.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/16604799", "release_id": 16604799, "date_created": "2019-04-07T14:00:31Z", "date_published": "2019-04-07T14:06:37Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/16022113", "tag": "v7.0.0", "name": "drake transformed", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# Version 7.0.0\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\n- The enhancements that increase cache access speed also invalidate targets in old projects. Workflows built with drake <= 6.2.1 will need to run from scratch again.\r\n- In `drake` plans, the `command` and `trigger` columns are now lists of language objects instead of character vectors. `make()` and friends still work if you have character columns, but the default output of `drake_plan()` has changed to this new format.\r\n- All parallel backends (`parallelism` argument of `make()`) except \"clustermq\" and \"future\" are removed. A new \"loop\" backend covers local serial execution.\r\n- A large amount of deprecated functionality is now defunct, including several functions (`built()`, `find_project()`, `imported()`, and `parallel_stages()`; [full list here](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/564)) and the single-quoted file API.\r\n- Set the default value of `lock_envir` to `TRUE` in `make()` and `drake_config()`. So `make()` will automatically quit in error if the act of building a target tries to change upstream dependencies.\r\n- `make()` no longer returns a value. Users will need to call `drake_config()` separately to get the old return value of `make()`.\r\n- Require the `jobs` argument to be of length 1 (`make()` and `drake_config()`). To parallelize the imports and other preprocessing steps, use `jobs_preprocess`, also of length 1.\r\n- Get rid of the \"kernels\" `storr` namespace. As a result, `drake` is faster, but users will no longer be able to load imported functions using `loadd()` or `readd()`.\r\n- In `target()`, users must now explicitly name all the arguments except `command`, e.g. `target(f(x), trigger = trigger(condition = TRUE))` instead of `target(f(x), trigger(condition = TRUE))`.\r\n- Fail right away in `bind_plans()` when the result has duplicated target names. This makes `drake`'s API more predictable and helps users catch malformed workflows earlier.\r\n- `loadd()` only loads targets listed in the plan. It no longer loads imports or file hashes.\r\n- The return values of `progress()`, `deps_code()`, `deps_target()`, and `predict_workers()` are now data frames.\r\n- Change the default value of `hover` to `FALSE` in visualization functions. Improves speed.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Allow `bind_plans()` to work with lists of plans (`bind_plans(list(plan1, plan2))` was returning `NULL` in `drake` 6.2.0 and 6.2.1).\r\n- Ensure that `get_cache(path = \"non/default/path\", search = FALSE)` looks for the cache in `\"non/default/path\"` instead of `getwd()`.\r\n- Remove strict dependencies on package `tibble`.\r\n- Pass the correct data structure to `ensure_loaded()` in `meta.R` and `triggers.R` when ensuring the dependencies of the `condition` and `change` triggers are loaded.\r\n- Require a `config` argument to `drake_build()` and `loadd(deps = TRUE)`.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Introduce a new experimental domain-specific language for generating large plans (#233). Details [here](https://ropenscilabs.github.io/drake-manual/plans.html#large-plans).\r\n- Implement a `lock_envir` argument to safeguard reproducibility. See [this thread](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/615#issuecomment-447585359) for a demonstration of the problem solved by `make(lock_envir = TRUE)`. More discussion: #619, #620.\r\n- The new `from_plan()` function allows the users to reference custom plan columns from within commands. Changes to values in these columns columns do not invalidate targets.\r\n- Add a menu prompt (https://github.com/ropensci/drake/pull/762) to safeguard against `make()` pitfalls in interactive mode (https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/761). Appears once per session. Disable with `options(drake_make_menu = FALSE)`.\r\n- Add new API functions `r_make()`, `r_outdated()`, etc. to run `drake` functions more reproducibly in a clean session. See the help file of `r_make()` for details.\r\n- `progress()` gains a `progress` argument for filtering results. For example, `progress(progress = \"failed\")` will report targets that failed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- **Large speed boost**: move away from `storr`'s key mangling in favor of `drake`'s own encoding of file paths and namespaced functions for `storr` keys.\r\n- Exclude symbols `.`, `..`, and `.gitignore` from being target names (consequence of the above).\r\n- Use only one hash algorithm per `drake` cache, which the user can set with the `hash_algorithm` argument of `new_cache()`, `storr::storr_rds()`, and various other cache functions. Thus, the concepts of a \"short hash algorithm\" and \"long hash algorithm\" are deprecated, and the functions `long_hash()`, `short_hash()`, `default_long_hash_algo()`, `default_short_hash_algo()`, and `available_hash_algos()` are deprecated. Caches are still back-compatible with `drake` > 5.4.0 and <= 6.2.1.\r\n- Allow the `magrittr` dot symbol to appear in some commands sometimes.\r\n- Deprecate the `fetch_cache` argument in all functions.\r\n- Remove packages `DBI` and `RSQLite` from \"Suggests\".\r\n- Define a special `config$eval <- new.env(parent = config$envir)` for storing built targets and evaluating commands in the plan. Now, `make()` no longer modifies the user's environment. This move is a long-overdue step toward purity.\r\n- Remove dependency on the `codetools` package.\r\n- Deprecate and remove the `session` argument of `make()` and `drake_config()`. Details: https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/623#issue-391894088.\r\n- Deprecate the `graph` and `layout` arguments to `make()` and `drake_config()`. The change simplifies the internals, and memoization allows us to do this.\r\n- Warn the user if running `make()` in a subdirectory of the `drake` project root (determined by the location of the `.drake` folder in relation to the working directory).\r\n- In the code analysis, explicitly prohibit targets from being dependencies of imported functions.\r\n- Increase options for the `verbose` argument, including the option to print execution and total build times.\r\n- Separate the building of targets from the processing of imports. Imports are processed with rudimentary staged parallelism (`mclapply()` or `parLapply()`, depending on the operating system).\r\n- Ignore the imports when it comes to build times. Functions `build_times()`, `predict_runtime()`, etc. focus on only the targets.\r\n- Deprecate many API functions, including `plan_analyses()`, `plan_summaries()`, `analysis_wildcard()`, `cache_namespaces()`, `cache_path()`, `check_plan()`, `dataset_wildcard()`, `drake_meta()`, `drake_palette()`, `drake_tip()`, `recover_cache()`, `cleaned_namespaces()`, `target_namespaces()`, `read_drake_config()`, `read_drake_graph()`, and `read_drake_plan()`.\r\n- Deprecate `target()` as a user-side function. From now on, it should only be called from within `drake_plan()`.\r\n- `drake_envir()` now throws an error, not a warning, if called in the incorrect context. Should be called only inside commands in the user's `drake` plan.\r\n- Replace `*expr*()` `rlang` functions with their `*quo*()` counterparts. We still keep `rlang::expr()` in the few places where we know the expressions need to be evaluated in `config$eval`.\r\n- The `prework` argument to `make()` and `drake_config()` can now be an expression (language object) or list of expressions. Character vectors are still acceptable.\r\n- At the end of `make()`, print messages about triggers etc. only if `verbose >= 2L`.\r\n- Deprecate and rename  `in_progress()` to `running()`.\r\n- Deprecate and rename  `knitr_deps()` to `deps_knitr()`.\r\n- Deprecate and rename  `dependency_profile()` to `deps_profile()`.\r\n- Deprecate and rename  `predict_load_balancing()` to `predict_workers()`.\r\n- Deprecate `this_cache()` and defer to `get_cache()` and `storr::storr_rds()` for simplicity.\r\n- Change the default value of `hover` to `FALSE` in visualization functions. Improves speed. Also a breaking change.\r\n- Deprecate `drake_cache_log_file()`. We recommend using `make()` with the `cache_log_file` argument to create the cache log. This way ensures that the log is always up to date with `make()` results.\r\n\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v7.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v7.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v7.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/16022113", "release_id": 16022113, "date_created": "2019-03-10T17:32:06Z", "date_published": "2019-03-10T20:58:47Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/14449716", "tag": "v6.2.1", "name": "CRAN hotfix", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "Version 6.2.1 is a hotfix to address the failing automated CRAN checks for 6.2.0.

Allows the user to set the delimiter for generating new target names.\r\n- Expose a `hasty_build` argument to `make()` and `drake_config()`.

This is an intermediate structure between the workflow plan data frame and the graph. It will help clean up the internals in future development.\r\n- Improve memoized preprocessing: deparse all the functions in the environment so the memoization does not react so spurious changes in R internals. Related: #345.\r\n- Use the `label` argument to `future()` inside `make(parallelism = \"future\")`. That way , job names are target names by default if `job.name` is used correctly in the `batchtools` template file.\r\n- Remove strict dependencies on packages `dplyr`, `evaluate`, `fs`, `future`, `magrittr`, `parallel`, `R.utils`, `stats`, `stringi`, `tidyselect`, and `withr`.\r\n- Remove package `rprojroot` from \"Suggests\".\r\n- Deprecate the `force` argument in all functions except `make()` and `drake_config()`.\r\n- Change the name of `prune_envir()` to `manage_memory()`.\r\n- Deprecate and rename the `pruning_strategy` argument to `memory_strategy` (`make()` and `drake_config()`).\r\n- Print warnings and messages to the `console_log_file` in real time ([#588](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/588)).\r\n- Use HTML line breaks in `vis_drake_graph()` hover text to display commands in the `drake` plan more elegantly.\r\n- Speed up `predict_load_balancing()` and remove its reliance on internals that will go away in 2019 via [#561](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/561).\r\n- Remove support for the `worker` column of `config$plan` in `predict_runtime()` and `predict_load_balancing()`.

New users can use this function to better understand the relationship between plans and code, and unsatisfied customers can use it to disentangle their projects from `drake` altogether. Similarly, `plan_to_notebook()` generates an R notebook from a `drake` plan.\r\n- Add a new `drake_debug()` function to run a target's command in debug mode. Analogous to `drake_build()`.\r\n- Add a `mode` argument to `trigger()` to control how the `condition` trigger factors into the decision to build or skip a target. See the `?trigger` for details.\r\n- Add a new `sleep` argument to `make()` and `drake_config()` to help the master process consume fewer resources during parallel processing.\r\n- Enable the `caching` argument for the `\"clustermq\"` and `\"clustermq_staged\"` parallel backends. Now, `make(parallelism = \"clustermq\", caching = \"master\")` will do all the caching with the master process, and `make(parallelism = \"clustermq\", caching = \"worker\")` will do all the caching with the workers. The same is true for `parallelism = \"clustermq_staged\"`.\r\n- Add a new `append` argument to `gather_plan()`, `gather_by()`, `reduce_plan()`, and `reduce_by()`. The `append` argument control whether the output includes the original `plan` in addition to the newly generated rows.\r\n- Add new functions `load_main_example()`, `clean_main_example()`, and `clean_mtcars_example()`.\r\n- Add a `filter` argument to `gather_by()` and `reduce_by()` in order to restrict what we gather even when `append` is `TRUE`.\r\n- Add a hasty mode: `make(parallelism = \"hasty\")` skips all of `drake`'s expensive caching and checking. All targets run every single time and you are responsible for saving results to custom output files, but almost all the by-target overhead is gone.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- Ensure commands in the plan are re-analyzed for dependencies when new imports are added (https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/548). Was a bug in version 6.0.0 only.\r\n- Call `path.expand()` on the `file` argument to `render_drake_graph()` and `render_sankey_drake_graph()`. That way, tildes in file paths no longer interfere with the rendering of static image files. Compensates for https://github.com/wch/webshot.\r\n- Skip tests and examples if the required \"Suggests\" packages are not installed.\r\n- Stop checking for non-standard columns. Previously, warnings about non-standard columns were incorrectly triggered by `evaluate_plan(trace = TRUE)` followed by `expand_plan()`, `gather_plan()`, `reduce_plan()`, `gather_by()`, or `reduce_by()`. The more relaxed behavior also gives users more options about how to construct and maintain their workflow plan data frames.\r\n- Use checksums in `\"future\"` parallelism to make sure files travel over network file systems before proceeding to downstream targets.\r\n- Refactor and clean up checksum code.\r\n- Skip more tests and checks if `visNetwork` is not installed.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Stop earlier in `make_targets()` if all the targets are already up to date.\r\n- Improve the documentation of the `seed` argument in `make()` and `drake_config()`.\r\n- Set the default `caching` argument of `make()` and `drake_config()` to `\"master\"` rather than `\"worker\"`. The default option should be the lower-overhead option for small workflows. Users have the option to make a different set of tradeoffs for larger workflows.\r\n- Allow the `condition` trigger to evaluate to non-logical values as long as those values can be coerced to logicals.\r\n- Require that the `condition` trigger evaluate to a vector of length 1.\r\n- Keep non-standard columns in `drake_plan_source()`.\r\n- `make(verbose = 4)` now prints to the console when a target is stored.\r\n- `gather_by()` and `reduce_by()` now gather/reduce everything if no columns are specified.\r\n- Change the default parallelization of the imports. Previously, `make(jobs = 4)` was equivalent to `make(jobs = c(imports = 4, targets = 4))`. Now, `make(jobs = 4)` is equivalent to `make(jobs = c(imports = 1, targets = 4))`. See [issue 553](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/553) for details.\r\n- Add a console message for building the priority queue when `verbose` is at least 2.\r\n- Condense `load_mtcars_example()`.\r\n- Deprecate the `hook` argument of `make()` and `drake_config()`.\r\n- In `gather_by()` and `reduce_by()`, do not exclude targets with all `NA` gathring variables.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v6.1.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v6.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v6.1.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/13676037", "release_id": 13676037, "date_created": "2018-10-26T12:14:07Z", "date_published": "2018-10-26T12:22:17Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/13166187", "tag": "v6.0.0", "name": "Major release: proper clustermq support and reduced overhead in make()", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nFor the sake of reproducibility and speed, `drake` version 6.0.0 is more discerning in how it detects dependencies: \r\n\r\n1. Targets in the plan.\r\n2. Functions and objects in the environment.\r\n3. Objects and functions from packages that are explicitly namespaced with `::` and `:::`.\r\n\r\nIn other words, there is a clearer line between what `drake` detects and what it does not. And it no longer dives into packages or parent environments automatically by default. The old approach \r\n\r\n1. Made workflows more brittle (likely to fall out of date).\r\n2. Was categorically inferior to `packrat` in terms of package reproducibility.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the change also puts old workflows out of date. Sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\nOther breaking changes that put old projects out of date:\r\n\r\n- Avoid serialization in `digest()` wherever possible. This puts old `drake` projects out of date, but it improves speed.\r\n- Require R version >= 3.3.0 rather than >= 3.2.0. Tests and checks still run fine on 3.3.0, but the required version of the `stringi` package no longer compiles on 3.2.0.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n- In the call to `unlink()` in `clean()`, set `recursive` and `force` to `FALSE`. This should prevent the accidental deletion of whole directories.\r\n- Previously, `clean()` deleted input-only files if no targets from the plan were cached. A patch and a unit test are included in this release.\r\n- `loadd(not_a_target)` no longer loads every target in the cache.\r\n- Exclude each target from its own dependency metadata in the \"deps\" `igraph` vertex attribute (fixes https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/503).\r\n- Detect inline code dependencies in `knitr_in()` file code chunks.\r\n- Remove more calls to `sort(NULL)` that caused warnings in R 3.3.3.\r\n- Fix a bug on R 3.3.3 where `analyze_loadd()` was sometimes quitting with \"Error: attempt to set an attribute on NULL\".\r\n- Do not call `digest::digest(file = TRUE)` on directories. Instead, set hashes of directories to `NA`. Users should still not directories as file dependencies.\r\n- If files are declared as dependnecies of custom triggers (\"condition\" and \"change\") include them in `vis_drake_graph()`. Previously, these files were missing from the visualization, but actual workflows worked just fine. Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52121537/trigger-notification-from-report-generation-in-r-drake-package\r\n- Work around mysterious `codetools` failures in R 3.3 (add a `tryCatch()` statement in `find_globals()`).\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n- Add a proper [`clustermq`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq)-based parallel backend: `make(parallelism = \"clustermq\")`.\r\n- `evaluate_plan(trace = TRUE)` now adds a `*_from` column to show the origins of the evaluated targets. Try `evaluate_plan(drake_plan(x = rnorm(n__), y = rexp(n__)), wildcard = \"n__\", values = 1:2, trace = TRUE)`.\r\n- Add functions `gather_by()` and `reduce_by()`, which gather on custom columns in the plan (or columns generated by `evaluate_plan(trace = TRUE)`) and append the new targets to the previous plan.\r\n- Expose the `template` argument of `clustermq` functions (e.g. `Q()` and `workers()`) as an argument of `make()` and `drake_config()`.\r\n- Add a new `code_to_plan()` function to turn R scripts and R Markdown reports into workflow plan data frames.\r\n- Add a new `drake_plan_source()` function, which generates lines of code for a `drake_plan()` call. This `drake_plan()` call produces the plan passed to `drake_plan_source()`. The main purpose is visual inspection (we even have syntax highlighting via `prettycode`) but users may also save the output to a script file for the sake of reproducibility or simple reference.\r\n- Deprecate `deps_targets()` in favor of a new `deps_target()` function (singular) that behaves more like `deps_code()`.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n- Smooth the edges in `vis_drake_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()`.\r\n- Make hover text slightly more readable in in `vis_drake_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()`.\r\n- Align hover text properly in `vis_drake_graph()` using the \"title\" node column.\r\n- Optionally collapse nodes into clusters with `vis_drake_graph(collapse = TRUE)`.\r\n- Improve `dependency_profile()` show major trigger hashes side-by-side\r\nto tell the user if the command, a dependency, an input file, or an ouptut file changed since the last `make()`.\r\n- Choose more appropriate places to check that the `txtq` package is installed.\r\n- Improve the help files of `loadd()` and `readd()`, giving specific usage guidance in prose.\r\n- Memoize all the steps of `build_drake_graph()` and print to the console the ones that execute.\r\n- Skip some tests if `txtq` is not installed.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v6.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v6.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v6.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/13166187", "release_id": 13166187, "date_created": "2018-09-29T21:58:01Z", "date_published": "2018-09-29T22:17:17Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/12554769", "tag": "v5.4.0.9000", "name": "Interim development release: proper clustermq support and memoized preprocessing", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "- Add a proper [`clustermq`](https://github.com/mschubert/clustermq)-based parallel backend: `make(parallelism = \"clustermq\")`.\r\n- Smooth the edges in `vis_drake_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()`.\r\n- Make hover text slightly more readable in in `vis_drake_graph()` and `render_drake_graph()`.\r\n- Align hover text properly in `vis_drake_graph()` using the \"title\" node column.\r\n- Optionally collapse nodes into clusters with `vis_drake_graph(collapse = TRUE)`.\r\n- Improve `dependency_profile()` show major trigger hashes side-by-side\r\nto tell the user if the command, a dependency, an input file, or an ouptut file changed since the last `make()`.\r\n- Choose more appropriate places to check that the `txtq` package is installed.\r\n- Expose the `template` argument of `clustermq` functions (e.g. `Q()` and `workers()`) as an argument of `make()` and `drake_config()`.\r\n- Improve the help files of `loadd()` and `readd()`, giving specific usage guidance in prose.\r\n- Bugfix: `loadd(not_a_target)` no longer loads every target in the cache.\r\n- Bugfix: exclude each target from its own dependency metadata in the \"deps\" `igraph` vertex attribute (fixes https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/503).\r\n- Add a new `code_to_plan()` function to turn R scripts and R Markdown reports into workflow plan data frames.\r\n- Add a new `drake_plan_source()` function, which generates lines of code for a `drake_plan()` call.

For the other `lapply`-like backends, `drake` uses persistent workers and a master process. In the case of `\"future_lapply\"` parallelism, the master process is a separate background process called by `Rscript`.\r\n- Remove the appearance of staged parallelism from single-job `make()`'s.\r\n(Previously, there were \"check\" messages and a call to `staged_parallelism()`.)\r\n- Remove uncontained remnants of staged parallelism internals.\r\n- Allow different parallel backends for imports vs targets. For example, `make(parallelism = c(imports = \"mclapply_staged\", targets = \"mclapply\")`.\r\n- Fix a bug in environment pruning. Previously, dependencies of downstream targets were being dropped from memory in `make(jobs = 1)`. Now, they are kept in memory until no downstream target needs them (for `make(jobs = 1)`).\r\n- Improve `predict_runtime()`. It is a more sensible way to go about predicting runtimes with multiple jobs. Likely to be more accurate.\r\n- Calls to `make()` no longer leave targets in the user's environment.\r\n- Attempt to fix a Solaris CRAN check error. The test at https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/b4dbddb840d2549621b76bcaa46c344b0fd2eccc/tests/testthat/test-edge-cases.R#L3 was previously failing on CRAN's Solaris machine (R 3.5.0). In the test, one of the threads deliberately quits in error, and the R/Solaris installation did not handle this properly. The test should work now because it no longer uses any parallelism.\r\n- Deprecate the `imports_only` argument to `make()` and `drake_config()` in favor of `skip_targets`.\r\n- Deprecate `migrate_drake_project()`.\r\n- Deprecate `max_useful_jobs()`.\r\n- For non-distributed parallel backends, stop waiting for all the imports to finish before the targets begin.\r\n- Add an `upstream_only` argument to `failed()` so users can list failed targets that do not have any failed dependencies.

This enforces more consistent behavior in the face of the current static code analysis funcionality, which sometimes detects `.` and sometimes does not.\r\n- Use `ignore()` to optionally ignore pieces of workflow plan commands and/or imported functions. Use `ignore(some_code)` to\r\n    1. Force `drake` to not track dependencies in `some_code`, and\r\n    2. Ignore any changes in `some_code` when it comes to deciding which target are out of date.\r\n- Force `drake` to only look for imports in environments inheriting from `envir` in `make()` (plus explicitly namespaced functions).\r\n- Force `loadd()` to ignore foreign imports (imports not explicitly found in `envir` when `make()` last imported them).\r\n- Reduce default verbosity. Only targets are printed out by default. Verbosity levels are integers ranging from 0 through 4.\r\n- Change `loadd()` so that only targets (not imports) are loaded if the `...` and `list` arguments are empty.\r\n- Add check to drake_plan() to check for duplicate targets\r\n- Add a `.gitignore` file containing `\"*\"` to the default `.drake/` cache folder every time `new_cache()` is called. This means the cache will not be automatically committed to git. Users need to remove `.gitignore` file to allow unforced commits, and then subsequent `make()`s on the same cache will respect the user's wishes and not add another `.gitignore`. this only works for the default cache. Not supported for manual `storr`s.\r\n- Add a new experimental `\"future\"` backend with a manual scheduler.\r\n- Implement `dplyr`-style `tidyselect` functionality in `loadd()`, `clean()`, and `build_times()`. For `build_times()`, there is an API change: for `tidyselect` to work, we needed to insert a new `...` argument as the first argument of `build_times()`.\r\n- Deprecate the single-quoting API for files. Users should now use formal API functions in their commands:\r\n    - `file_in()` for file inputs to commands or imported functions (for imported functions, the input file needs to be an imported file, not a target).\r\n    - `file_out()` for output file targets (ignored if used in imported functions).\r\n    - `knitr_in()` for `knitr`/`rmarkdown` reports. This tells `drake` to look inside the source file for target dependencies in code chunks (explicitly referenced with `loadd()` and `readd()`). Treated as a `file_in()` if used in imported functions.\r\n- Change `drake_plan()` so that it automatically fills in any target names that the user does not supply. Also, any `file_out()`s become the target names automatically (double-quoted internally).\r\n- Make `read_drake_plan()` (rather than an empty `drake_plan()`) the default `plan` argument in all functions that accept a `plan`.\r\n- Add support for active bindings: `loadd(..., lazy = \"bind\")`. That way, when you have a target loaded in one R session and hit `make()` in another R session, the target in your first session will automatically update.\r\n- Use tibbles for workflow plan data frames and the output of `dataframes_graph()`.\r\n- Return warnings, errors, and other context of each build, all wrapped up with the usual metadata. `diagnose()` will take on the role of returning this metadata.\r\n- Deprecate the `read_drake_meta()` function in favor of `diagnose()`.\r\n- Add a new `expose_imports()` function to optionally force `drake` detect deeply nested functions inside specific packages.\r\n- Move the \"quickstart.Rmd\" vignette to \"example-basic.Rmd\". The so-called \"quickstart\" didn't end up being very quick, and it was all about the basic example anyway.\r\n- Move `drake_build()` to be an exclusively user-side function.\r\n- Add a `replace` argument to `loadd()` so that objects already in the user's eOne small thing:nvironment need not be replaced.\r\n- When the graph cyclic, print out all the cycles.\r\n- Prune self-referential loops (and duplicate edges) from the workflow graph. That way, recursive functions are allowed.\r\n- Add a `seed` argument to `make()`, `drake_config()`, and `load_basic_example()`. Also hard-code a default seed of `0`. That way, the pseudo-randomness in projects should be reproducible\r\nacross R sessions.\r\n- Cache the pseudo-random seed at the time the project is created and use that seed to build targets until the cache is destroyed.\r\n- Add a new `drake_read_seed()` function to read the seed from the cache. Its examples illustrate what `drake` is doing to try to ensure reproducible random numbers.\r\n- Evaluate the quasiquotation operator `!!` for the `...` argument to `drake_plan()`. Suppress this behavior using `tidy_evaluation = FALSE` or by passing in commands passed through the `list` argument.\r\n- Preprocess workflow plan commands with `rlang::expr()` before evaluating them. That means you can use the quasiquotation operator `!!` in your commands, and `make()` will evaluate them according to the tidy evaluation paradigm.\r\n- Restructure `drake_example(\"basic\")`, `drake_example(\"gsp\")`, and `drake_example(\"packages\")` to demonstrate how to set up the files for serious `drake` projects. More guidance was needed in light of [this issue](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/issues/193).\r\n- Improve the examples of `drake_plan()` in the help file (`?drake_plan`).\r\n\r\n# Version 5.0.0\r\n\r\n- Transfer `drake` to rOpenSci: https://github.com/ropensci/drake\r\n- Several functions now require an explicit `config` argument, which you can get from\r\n`drake_config()` or `make()`. Examples:\r\n    - outdated()\r\n    - missed()\r\n    - rate_limiting_times()\r\n    - predict_runtime()\r\n    - vis_drake_graph()\r\n    - dataframes_graph()\r\n- Always process all the imports before building any targets. This is part of the solution to #168: if imports and targets are processed together, the full power of parallelism is taken away from the targets. Also, the way parallelism happens is now consistent for all parallel backends.\r\n- Major speed improvement: dispense with internal inventories and rely on `cache$exists()` instead.\r\n- Let the user define a trigger for each target to customize when `make()` decides to build targets.\r\n- Document triggers and other debugging/testing tools in the new [debug vignette](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/vignettes/debug.Rmd).\r\n- Restructure the internals of the `storr` cache in a way that is not back-compatible with projects from versions 4.4.0 and earlier. The main change is to make more intelligent use of `storr` namespaces, improving efficiency (both time and storage) and opening up possibilities for new features. If you attempt to run drake >= 5.0.0 on a project from drake <= 4.0.0, drake will stop you before any damage to the cache is done, and you will be instructed how to migrate your project to the new drake.\r\n- Use `formatR::tidy_source()` instead of `parse()` in `tidy_command()` (originally `tidy()` in `R/dependencies.R`). Previously, `drake` was having problems with an edge case: as a command, the literal string `\"A\"` was interpreted as the symbol `A` after tidying. With `tidy_source()`, literal quoted strings stay literal quoted strings in commands. This may put some targets out of date in old projects, yet another loss of back compatibility in version 5.0.0.\r\n- Speed up clean() by refactoring the cache inventory and using light parallelism.\r\n- Implement `rescue_cache()`, exposed to the user and used in `clean()`. This function removes dangling orphaned files in the cache so that a broken cache can be cleaned and used in the usual ways once more.\r\n- Change the default `cpu` and `elapsed` arguments of `make()` to `NULL`. This solves an elusive bug in how drake imposes timeouts.\r\n- Allow users to set target-level timeouts (overall, cpu, and elapsed) with columns in the workflow plan data frame.\r\n- Document timeouts and retries in the new [debug vignette](https://github.com/ropensci/drake/blob/master/vignettes/debug.Rmd).\r\n- Add a new `graph` argument to functions `make()`, `outdated()`, and `missed()`.\r\n- Export a new `prune_graph()` function for igraph objects.\r\n- Delete long-deprecated functions `prune()` and `status()`.\r\n- Deprecate and rename functions:\r\n    - `analyses()` => `plan_analyses()`\r\n    - `as_file()` => `as_drake_filename()`\r\n    - `backend()` => `future::plan()`\r\n    - `build_graph()` => `build_drake_graph()`\r\n    - `check()` => `check_plan()`\r\n    - `config()` => `drake_config()`\r\n    - `evaluate()` => `evaluate_plan()`\r\n    - `example_drake()` => `drake_example()`\r\n    - `examples_drake()` => `drake_examples()`\r\n    - `expand()` => `expand_plan()`\r\n    - `gather()` => `gather_plan()`\r\n    - `plan()`, `workflow()`, `workplan()` => `drake_plan()`\r\n    - `plot_graph()` => `vis_drake_graph()`\r\n    - `read_config()` => `read_drake_config()`\r\n    - `read_graph()` => `read_drake_graph()`\r\n    - `read_plan()` => `read_drake_plan()`\r\n    - `render_graph()` => `render_drake_graph()`\r\n    - `session()` => `drake_session()`\r\n    - `summaries()` => `plan_summaries()`\r\n- Disallow `output` and `code` as names in the workflow plan data frame. Use `target` and `command` instead. This naming switch has been formally deprecated for several months prior.\r\n- Deprecate the ..analysis.. and ..dataset.. wildcards in favor of analysis__ and dataset__, respectively. The new wildcards are stylistically better an pass linting checks.\r\n- Add new functions `drake_quotes()`, `drake_unquote()`, and `drake_strings()` to remove the silly dependence on the `eply` package.\r\n- Add a `skip_safety_checks` flag to `make()` and `drake_config()`. Increases speed.\r\n- In `sanitize_plan()`, remove rows with blank targets \"\".\r\n- Add a `purge` argument to `clean()` to optionally remove all target-level information.\r\n- Add a `namespace` argument to `cached()` so users can inspect individual `storr` namespaces.\r\n- Change `verbose` to numeric: 0 = print nothing, 1 = print progress on imports only, 2 = print everything.\r\n- Add a new `next_stage()` function to report the targets to be made in the next parallelizable stage.\r\n- Add a new `session_info` argument to `make()`. Apparently, `sessionInfo()` is a bottleneck for small `make()`s, so there is now an option to suppress it. This is mostly for the sake of speeding up unit tests.\r\n- Add a new `log_progress` argument to `make()` to suppress progress logging.

Check out arguments `from`, `mode`, `order`, and `subset`. The [graphing vignette](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/vignettes/graph.Rmd) has demonstrations.\r\n- Add `\"future_lapply\"` parallelism: parallel backends supported by the [future](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future) and [future.batchtools](https://github.com/HenrikBengtsson/future.batchtools) packages. See `?backend` for examples and the [parallelism vignette](https://github.com/wlandau-lilly/drake/blob/master/vignettes/parallelism.Rmd) for an introductory tutorial. More advanced instruction can be found in the `future` and `future.batchtools` packages themselves.\r\n- Cache diagnostic information of targets that fail and retrieve diagnostic info with `diagnose()`.\r\n- Add an optional `hook` argument to `make()` to wrap around `build()`. That way, users can more easily control the side effects of distributed jobs. For example, to redirect error messages to a file in `make(..., parallelism = \"Makefile\", jobs = 2, hook = my_hook)`, `my_hook` should be something like `function(code){withr::with_message_sink(\"messages.txt\", code)}`.\r\n- Remove console logging for \"parLapply\" parallelism. `Drake` was previously using the `outfile` argument for PSOCK clusters to generate output that could not be caught by `capture.output()`. It was a hack that should have been removed before.\r\n- Remove console logging for \"parLapply\" parallelism. `Drake` was previously using the `outfile` argument for PSOCK clusters to generate output that could not be caught by `capture.output()`. It was a hack that should have been removed before.\r\n- If 'verbose' is 'TRUE' and all targets are already up to date (nothing to build), then `make()` and `outdated()` print \"All targets are already up to date\" to the console.\r\n- Add new examples in 'inst/examples', most of them demonstrating how to use the `\"future_lapply\"` backends.\r\n- New support for timeouts and retries when it comes to building targets.\r\n- Failed targets are now recorded during the build process. You can see them in `plot_graph()` and `progress()`. Also see the new `failed()` function, which is similar to `in_progress()`.\r\n- Speed up the overhead of `parLapply` parallelism. The downside to this fix is that `drake` has to be properly installed. It should not be loaded with `devtools::load_all()`. The speedup comes from lightening the first `clusterExport()` call in `run_parLapply()`. Previously, we exported every single individual `drake` function to all the workers, which created a bottleneck. Now, we just load `drake` itself in each of the workers, which works because `build()` and `do_prework()` are exported. \r\n- Change default value of `overwrite` to `FALSE` in `load_basic_example()`.\r\n- Warn when overwriting an existing `report.Rmd` in `load_basic_example()`.\r\n- Tell the user the location of the cache using a console message. Happens on every call to `get_cache(..., verbose = TRUE)`.\r\n- Increase efficiency of internal preprocessing via `lightly_parallelize()` and `lightly_parallelize_atomic()`. Now, processing happens faster, and only over the unique values of a vector.\r\n- Add a new `storr` namespace called `imports` to be used in `is_imported()`. That way, the whole object need not be read to `clean()` is. `clean()` is much faster and safer.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v4.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v4.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v4.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/8388067", "release_id": 8388067, "date_created": "2017-11-03T19:30:21Z", "date_published": "2017-11-05T05:20:15Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/8156970", "tag": "v4.3.0", "name": "Reproducible random numbers, knitr awareness, more docs, minor bugfixes", "author": {"name": "wlandau-lilly", "type": "User"}, "description": "Most critically of all, this release readies `drake` for the upcoming [testthat](https://github.com/r-lib/testthat) version 2.0.0.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/tarball/v4.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/zipball/v4.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/drake/releases/tag/v4.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/8156970", "release_id": 8156970, "date_created": "2017-10-17T21:16:31Z", "date_published": "2017-10-17T21:45:39Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/drake/releases/7947733", "tag": "v4.2.0", "name": "Predict runtimes, externalize caches/hashes", "author": {"name": "wlandau-lilly", "type": "User"}, "description": "There are several improvements to code style and performance.
