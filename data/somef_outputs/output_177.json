Please submit your pull requests to `development`.\n\n## Repository structure\n\nThis repository is structured as a standard R package following the conventions outlined in the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book. A few additional files are provided that are not part of the built\nR package and are listed in `.Rbuildignore`, such as `.travis.yml`, which is used for continuous testing and integration.\n\n## Code\n\nAll code for this package is found in `R/`. All functions should be thoroughly documented with `roxygen2` notation; see Documentation. Code should conform to the tidyverse [Style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/index.html).\n\n## Testing\n\nAny new feature or bug-fix should include a unit-test demonstrating the change.  Unit tests follow the `testthat` framework with files in `tests/testthat`.  Please make sure that the testing suite passes before issuing a pull request.  This can be done by running `check()` from the `devtools` package, which will also check for consistent documentation, etc.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll of the function documentation is generated automatically. Please do not edit any of the documentation files in `man/` or the `NAMESPACE`.  Instead, construct the appropriate [roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) documentation in the function files in `R/` themselves.  The documentation is then generated by running the `devtools::document()` function.  Please consult the [R Packages](https://r-pkgs.org/) book if this workflow is unfamiliar to you.  Note that functions should include examples in the documentation. Please use `\\dontrun` for examples that take more than a few seconds.\n\nSimilarly, the `.md` files in the base directory should not be edited directly. Instead, edit the `.Rmd` source files.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThis package already contains a large number of dependencies (imports and suggests). Therefore, new packages should only be added when creating new features that cannot be reasonably achieved within the existing set of dependencies.\n\n## General Development Goals & Guidelines\n\n1. Contribute code to create, use, and convert ecocomDP datasets.\n2. Maintain a consistent user-facing API.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThese contributing guidelines are based on those of the [rOpenSci emld project](https://github.com/ropensci/emld/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Community contributions are welcome!

or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at info@edirepository.org. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\nProject maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n[homepage]: http://contributor-covenant.org\n[version]: http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/tree/main/docs", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "- [Model\n  Overview](https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/articles/model_overview.html)\n- [Shared Practices for Creating ecocomDP\n  Data](https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/articles/shared_practices_create.html)\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Model documentation", "parent_header": ["ecocomDP <a href=\"https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/\"><img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"138\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/main/README.Rmd"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "Get the latest CRAN release:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"ecocomDP\")\n```\n\nGet the latest development version:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"EDIorg/ecocomDP\", ref = \"development\")\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Installation", "parent_header": ["ecocomDP <a href=\"https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/\"><img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"138\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/main/README.Rmd"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "- [Create ecocomDP\n  Data](https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/articles/create.html)\n- [Use ecocomDP\n  Data](https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/articles/use.html)\n- [Convert ecocomDP Data to Another Model\n  Format](https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/articles/convert.html)\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Usage", "parent_header": ["ecocomDP <a href=\"https://ediorg.github.io/ecocomDP/\"><img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"138\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"value": "Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/EDIorg/ecocomDP/issues) for bug\nreporting, feature requests, and general questions/discussions.
