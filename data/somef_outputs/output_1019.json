It is also designed to be used as a baseline method for developers\n  of new nowcasting methods. It supports standard data frame inputs with reference\n  date, report date, and count columns, is compatible with 'epinowcast' objects, and\n  also supports direct use of reporting triangles. Alongside an opinionated default\n  workflow, it has a low-level pipe-friendly modular interface, allowing context-specific\n  workflows. It can accommodate a wide spectrum of reporting schedules, including\n  mixed patterns of reference and reporting (daily-weekly, weekly-daily). It also\n  supports sharing delay distributions and uncertainty estimates between strata, as\n  well as custom uncertainty models and delay estimation methods. For more details\n  on the performance of the method(s) in this package applied to case studies of COVID-19\n  and norovirus, see our recent [pre-print](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.14.25333653v2).\nauthors:\n- family-names: Johnson\n  given-names: Kaitlyn\n  email: kaitlyn.johnson@lshtm.ac.uk\n  orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8011-0012\n- family-names: Tyszka\n  given-names: Emily\n  email: etsyzka@umass.edu\n  orcid: https://orcid.org/0009-0005-6088-4017\n- family-names: Bracher\n  given-names: Johannes\n  email: johannes.bracher@kit.edu\n  orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3777-1410\n- family-names: Funk\n  given-names: Sebastian\n  email: sebastian.funk@lshtm.ac.uk\n  orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2842-3406\n- family-names: Abbott\n  given-names: Sam\n  email: contact@samabbott.co.uk\n  orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8057-8037\npreferred-citation:\n  type: article\n  title: Baseline nowcasting methods for handling delays in epidemiological data\n  authors:\n  -
