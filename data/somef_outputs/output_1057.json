"contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "# Welcome to GlobalChem Contributing Guide! \n\nThank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on either the node contribution list or the extension contribution list. In this guide you will get an overview of how to get started in contributing into GlobalChem.\n\n## Contributing to GlobalChem\n\n### Filing an Issue\n\nGlobalChem is a collection of lists and most likely if you published an academic paper highlighting structural trends for small molecules or gathered data from some other source you would\nmost likely want people to use your data so you can create a node and add it to our network. \n\nFirst file an issue, place your initials of username or name followed by an issue number that is in respect to you. For me it is:\n\n```\nSS-1, SS-2, SS-3\n```\n\nBut for let's say one of other developers it is:\n\n```\nBL-1, Bl-2, BL-3\n```\n\nFile an issue and reference the paper or data source you would like to add. Let's use the Common Excipients as our example: https://doi.org/10.1002/jps.24643.\n\n### Adding your Node\n\nLet's say we want to add common excipients for these biopharmaceutics class III of compounds of Cimetidine and acyclovir. We add data in two forms IUPAC/SMILES, and IUPAC/SMARTS. Each node is represented as a class\nobject like so:\n\nWe can write a file called the node like so and each node is written in the exact same way.\n\n```python\nclass CimetidineAndAcyclovir(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n\n        self.name = 'cimetidine_and_acyclovir'\n```\n\nThe class is camel case where the name attribute is separated by a `_`. So in this paper there is a list of chemical functional groups relevant to paper. What we do\nis read the functional groups and translate them down into a language we can write as english, IUPAC. Now if you don't know how to begin, you can actually\nuse this free service by ChemDraw online:\n\nhttps://chemdrawdirect.perkinelmer.cloud/js/sample/index.html#\n\nRedraw the molecules into here and then click this button::\n\n<img width=\"941\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 9 09 51 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11812946/167297711-f0f434a3-65bd-437d-af0b-17fc9891b7b6.png\">\n\nWhen that happens you will get:\n\n<img width=\"272\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 9 09 41 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11812946/167297718-d66918fd-c3dd-49c0-bf26-604e34b77ef0.png\">\n\nA name for it. Now you can add that name to the list like so:\n\n```python\n\nclass CimetidineAndAcyclovir(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n\n        self.name = 'cimetidine_and_acyclovir'\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_smiles():\n\n        smiles = {\n            'hexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexaol': '',\n        }\n        \n    return\n```\n\nNow part of GlobalChem's benefit is that we started to move into more common language natural names rather than IUPAC defined rules. This is something we can speak. Traditionally, I want to remove numbers entirely in the dataset which will be a big curation day. So as we progress further that's something we want to preserve. If you put that name in google, chances are you will find synonyms like a thesauras and what we are looking for is something we can pronounce like `mannitol`. I can say it out loud. Now you can also use ChemDraw to download the SMILES or write it yourself and place it in the string.\n\n```python\n\nclass CimetidineAndAcyclovir(object):\n\n    def __init__(self):\n\n        self.name = 'cimetidine_and_acyclovir'\n\n    @staticmethod\n    def get_smiles():\n\n        smiles = {\n            'mannitol': 'C(C(C(C(C(CO)O)O)O)O)O',\n        }\n        \n    return\n```    \n\n Do that for the whole list!\n \n #### Bonus\n \nIf you want to generate the SMARTS string. I usually take the SMILES string and convert to `RDKit` Mol Object and then to SMARTS. If the SMILES is written nicely the SMARTS is written nicely.\n\n\n```python\n\nfrom rdkit import Chem\n\nsmiles = {\n    'mannitol': 'C(C(C(C(C(CO)O)O)O)O)O',\n}\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n    for k, v in smiles.items():\n\n        print (f\"'{k}': '{Chem.MolToSmarts(Chem.MolFromSmiles(v))}',\")\n```\n\nCommit your file on a branch and we will handle the organization as it gets included into the network!\n\n\n## Contributing to GlobalChemExtensions\n\nLet's say you have a function or feature you would like to add that you think would be useful. Most often in academia with the wide use of python there are loose scripts floating around that could be of useful functionality but no proper way to distribute it or a medium. If there is a proper distribution most often it is drowned in the noise of publications. To restore some of this useful features, we wet lab scientists are exploring lots of different software to highlight the best and add it to our collection so we can preserve it's functionality. \n\n### Adding your script\n\nIf you have a python file that you would like to add to the `GlobalChemExtensions` then please navigate to the folder structure which looks like this:\n\n<img width=\"899\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 9 20 46 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11812946/167298165-88d9f636-f689-4237-886b-9eb36874d7e5.png\">\n\nEach field is an object with applications that are useful for them:\n\n<img width=\"949\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 9 21 56 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11812946/167298204-ccc899fa-d739-458c-9de7-7247ce81feb2.png\">\n\nThe cheminformatics have a plethora of functionality spread from different packages:\n\n<img width=\"920\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-05-08 at 9 22 56 AM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11812946/167298232-930dceb4-a3d3-4916-9a3e-f0f3b42820ba.png\">\n\nAdd your script here and explain your functionality.
