If not all specified md files are found, extraction will be based on the files available @gabinoumbe in https://github.com/kit-data-manager/tomo_mapper/pull/58\r\n* All image metadata extracted will now be written to the output, even if their DatasetType cannot be determined. In this case a dataset will be created based on the folder structure of the images and on their detector information, if available. @GGoetzelmann in https://github.com/kit-data-manager/tomo_mapper/pull/62\r\n* Improved date/time handling by @gabinoumbe in https://github.com/kit-data-manager/tomo_mapper/pull/63\r\n\r\n### Fixed\r\n* Fix executable: package magika model file by @GGoetzelmann in https://github.com/kit-data-manager/tomo_mapper/pull/71\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**:
