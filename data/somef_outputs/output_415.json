This is entirely enabled by the amazing [delvewheel](https://github.com/adang1345/delvewheel) project (non-static dependencies can now easily be packaged into a built wheel for Python).\r\n\r\n## Python Changes\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\n\r\n-   Added support for Python 3.12 ([\\#315](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/315)).\r\n-   Dropped support for Python 3.8 ([\\#310](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/310)) and Python 3.9 ([\\#315](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/315)).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n-   Add `DEVELOPMENT.rst` section about configuring a shell and compilers for Windows development ([\\#311](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/311)). This had been a hodge podge of local and remote (CI) development for the last 5+ years, so this a big milestone!", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/tarball/2024.6.20", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/zipball/2024.6.20", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/releases/tag/2024.6.20", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/161596115", "release_id": 161596115, "date_created": "2024-06-21T03:54:43Z", "date_published": "2024-06-21T04:18:55Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/114076950", "tag": "2023.7.28", "name": "2023.7.28", "author": {"name": "dhermes", "type": "User"}, "description": "[![PyPI link to release 2023.7.28](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bezier/2023.7.28.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/bezier/2023.7.28/) [![Documentation for release 2023.7.28](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bezier/badge/?version=2023.7.28)](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2023.7.28/)\r\n\r\n## Robustness\r\n\r\n-   Fall back to de Casteljau algorithm for evaluation on high degree curves ([#264](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/264)). Fixed [#263](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/263). The more efficient `evaluate_multi_vs()` [function](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2023.7.28/python/reference/bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers.html#bezier.hazmat.curve_helpers.evaluate_multi_vs) relies on the ability to compute binomial coefficients `(n C k)` but after `(55 C 26)` these values cannot be computed in floating point without roundoff and for very large degrees these values overflow.\r\n\r\n## Python Changes\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\n\r\n-   Switched to [delvewheel](https://github.com/adang1345/delvewheel) for repairing Windows wheels ([#307](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/307)). This is similar to how Linux and macOS packaging already work. This is vastly superior to the homegrown approach previously used with `extra-dll`.\r\n-   Dropped support for Python 3.7 and added support for Python 3.10 and 3.11 ([#271](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/271), [#302](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/302)).\r\n-   Add strict check for Python version on source installs. Fixed [#278](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/278).\r\n-   Make missing `BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX` error message more helpful. In particular, add a suggestion to set `BEZIER_NO_EXTENSION` for a source only install if `BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX` cannot be set. Fixed [#277](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/277).\r\n-   Use [cibuildwheel](https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel) to automate building wheels as part of release ([#308](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/308)).\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n-   Allow the extra DLL directory to be absent on Windows. For binary wheel installs, this directory contains the `libbezier` DLL (e.g. `bezier.libs\\bezier-2a44d276.dll`). For pure Python installs, the `bezier.libs` directory will be absent. ([#307](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/307), [#255](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/255)). Fixed [#254](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/254).\r\n-   Bug fix for `clip_range()` ([doc](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2023.7.28/python/reference/bezier.hazmat.clipping.html#bezier.hazmat.clipping.clip_range)). Intersections with the `t=0` / `t=1` sides of the fat line were not taken into account **and** a value for `s_max` could be accidentally left unset if the intersections occurred in an order where the `s`-value decreased throughout ([#259](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/259)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n-   Removing `Surface` alias for the `Triangle` [type](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2023.7.28/python/reference/bezier.triangle.html#bezier.triangle.Triangle) ([#252](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/252)). The `Surface` type was deprecated (and converted to an alias) in the `2020.1.14` release.\r\n\r\n### Additive Changes\r\n\r\n-   Renaming all \\\"private\\\" `_verify` args to `verify` ([#251](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/251)). For example, in `Curve.intersect()` ([doc](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2023.7.28/python/reference/bezier.curve.html#bezier.curve.Curve.intersect))\r\n-   Adding provisional support for self-intersection checks in planar curves ([#265](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/265), [#267](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/267)). Fixed [#165](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/165) and [#171](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/171). Supported via `Curve.self_intersections()` [method](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2023.7.28/python/reference/bezier.curve.html#bezier.curve.Curve.self_intersections).\r\n-   Added `alpha` argument to `Triangle.plot()` and `CurvedPolygon.plot()` methods ([#296](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/296)).\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\n-   Making all docs pages import external packages at least once ([#257](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/257)).

Achieved with the following PRs\r\n\r\n    -   Added `CMakeLists.txt` files to enable building `libbezier` with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) ([\\#175](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/175)).\r\n    -   Added `-DTARGET_NATIVE_ARCH:BOOL=OFF` flag to enable portable release builds ([\\#182](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/182)).\r\n\r\n    and closed the following issues\r\n\r\n    -   Use a shared library (rather than a static library) for `libbezier` ([\\#54](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/54)).\r\n    -   Enable Python installs to be \"hybrid-editable\" ([\\#56](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/56)). (This means that the Python files reference the source tree but the built components, i.e. `libbezier` and `_speedup.so`, are already built and utilize caching of [CMake](https://cmake.org/).)\r\n    -   Use build system other than Python / `distutils` / `setuptools` ([\\#62](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/62)).\r\n    -   Add ability to disable `-march=native` flag to make release builds portable across compatible operating systems ([\\#181](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/181)).\r\n\r\nPython Changes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### Additive Changes\r\n\r\n-   Exposing `Curve.evaluate_hodograph()` [method](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/2020.2.3/python/reference/bezier.curve.html#bezier.curve.Curve.evaluate_hodograph) as part of the public API ([\\#191](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/191)). Fixed [\\#138](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/138).\r\n\r\n### Packaging\r\n\r\n-   Removed build dependency on `gfortran` and other heavyweight tools (and hacks) such as `numpy.distutils`. Now, `libbezier` must be built before the Python package can be installed and the install location must be provided via the `BEZIER_INSTALL_PREFIX` environment variable. Achieved with the following PRs\r\n    -   Requiring prebuilt `libbezier` when building `bezier._speedup` Python binary extension ([\\#176](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/176)).\r\n    -   Support building of wheels on all platforms that depend on `libbezier` ([\\#182](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/182)).\r\n-   Switch from `manylinux1` to `manylinux2010` for built wheels ([\\#178](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/178)).\r\n-   Delaying imports of `pkg_resources`, `scipy` and `sympy` until actually needed (if ever) ([\\#194](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/194), [\\#195](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/195), [38602d8](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/38602d88714b5358fdab2730392c7bbf27b2b8c2)).\r\n-   Adding `matplotlib` to `pip install bezier[full]` ([8beb036](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/8beb036ce06decb26ae25de118a8a3778c18c519)).\r\n-   Avoiding `bezier.dll` name collision on Windows in wheels distributed on PyPI ([\\#190](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/190)). Fixed [\\#189](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/189).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n-   Removed `bezier.get_dll()` helper ([\\#184](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/184)).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n-   Changed \"Read the Docs\" landing page to point to `.../stable/` documentation (i.e. the last published release) instead of `.../latest` documentation (i.e. the last **merged** commit).\r\n-   Making sure [CMake](https://cmake.org/) installed trees (on Linux, macOS and Windows) are verified in `doctest` as part of CI ([48e4166](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/48e416651878f02f7fce35e4944c56ba98463427)).\r\n-   Making sure `example_*.c` ABI examples are compiled and run (on Linux and macOS) in `doctest` as part of CI ([ffdcdf7](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/ffdcdf7e0b6608bb2a2b37337abbf49090f922c2), [9551495](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/95514952d54224d52d909876cb54bb75e672b653), [0766649](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/07666494a318d81770323a03aba694a282a8434b)).\r\n-   Converting (untested, potentially stale) console codeblocks to `doctest` (that get run in CI) for Linux sections of binary extension documentation ([\\#188](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/188)).

Previously these algorithms invoked the equivalent Fortran speedup if present for a given function. Fixed [\\#159](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/159).\r\n\r\n## Miscellany\r\n\r\n- Moved `*.f90` Fortran files **out** of Python source tree ([\\#152](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/152)).\r\n\r\n# ABI Changes\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Added `BEZ_` prefix for exported ABI names ([\\#167](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/pull/167)).

With the impending [EOL](https://pythonclock.org/) of Python 2.7 on January 1, 2020 many of the `bezier` dependencies such as `numpy`, `scipy` and `pytest` have dropped support for Python 2.7 in their latest releases. Some changes related to this include:\r\n    -   Removing support for Python 2.7 ([3eaa5aa](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/3eaa5aaa670d167b2c1340d3d531d5438eaf62cd)).\r\n    -   Updating all PyPy usage to be Python 3 only ([1e3037f](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/1e3037fce5acdcfa194cac481ee06ef6bcc329e5)).\r\n    -   Removing `_bool_patch.h` ([4ccc559](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4ccc559e6928f78556c1201f45a2ad7b3b40d7a5)).\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\n-   Integrating `black` [code formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io) into the `nox --session lint` session to ensure consistent formatting ([e659532](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/e659532747d0433bf3a91198a7baf172ed36f069)).\r\n-   Fully automating the building of wheels in the `bezier-wheels` [project](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier-wheels) ([recent commits](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier-wheels/compare/ee008511d5ff2736dfb44f770552e7553b00e8f0...424453f50fbb8f240ca60280b637a278f6e9ad4a)). Built wheels are uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.\r\n-   Using the same set of optimal flags for Fortran 77 code (i.e. `.f` files) that are used for Fortran 90 code (i.e. `.f90` files) ([e7eb56e](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/e7eb56e723f13d43f6eae855e6556b4ccbc1edd9)).\r\n-   Unify `requirements.txt` files and add notes about why each dependency is required ([230814d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/230814d67e24f42f967a652ff7e8d81ee2176954), [1ae147f](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/1ae147f81e7a01ba672806a8fd56de25ba2bdcdb), [e710ee6](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/e710ee6968438cb2462ec8bea8af407159a63925)).\r\n-   Changing `imp` usage to `importlib` due to deprecation of the former ([9231d92](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/9231d92b420df1ed97ae2b159bd0aedf0c1ff888)). Fixed [\\#137](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/137).\r\n-   Ditching the `--check-archs` flag in the macOS script for building wheels since we can no longer support 32-bit on macOS due to NumPy ([37be384](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/37be3845750ff0fe9f200f87a8427b05639c3a61)).\r\n-   Improved dev experience with Docker image used on CircleCI by adding a `.dockerignore` file for faster builds, suggesting `--workdir` and flag during local dev, setting `WHEELHOUSE` environment variable directly in the container (rather than in the CircleCI settings) and allowing \"default\" locations for pre-built wheels at `/wheelhouse` and `${HOME}/wheelhouse` ([08be336](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/08be336efac467beeb7055cfc80996b97482456a), [26acc38](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/26acc384d857cf9f5ddd8260ef50b7bcffeeb133), [7634779](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/763477958c73a4eb6ce0f89b6b37887c66c10706), [f9a8fcf](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/f9a8fcf275b244d962fae1e93b223af0c78285cc)).\r\n\r\nMiscellany\r\n----------\r\n\r\n-   Make some functional test cases more lenient so that they pass on 32-bit CentOS 5, which is used for `manylinux` ([e7eb56e](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/e7eb56e723f13d43f6eae855e6556b4ccbc1edd9)). This was part of a large effort to fully automate the building of wheels in the `bezier-wheels` [project](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier-wheels).\r\n-   Replacing `pypy` with `pypy3` in testing as the only non-CPython \"unofficially supported\" runtime. (This is part of the drop in support for Python 2.7.) Unfortunately the currently (as of August 2019) released versions of `pypy3` are not currently working with `numpy >= 1.16` (see [numpy/numpy\\#12740](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/12740)) so the `numpy == 1.15.4` version is a pinned dependency.\r\n    -   Specifying the NumPy version in `setup.py` based on `implementation_name` ([7e9046d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/7e9046dc9dbe6f448238141221c5a7dff497d8d4)).\r\n    -   Add `_pypy_speedup.c` built with Cython 0.29.11 because the latest Cython (0.29.13 as of August 2019) corresponds to the versions of NumPy that are incompatible with PyPy ([7813e41](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/7813e41f7666fa36fbb4a7daf0aa45c2d2bee87f)).\r\n    -   Pinning to `numpy==1.15.4` and `scipy==1.2.0` in wheelhouse for pre-built Docker container ([7634779](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/763477958c73a4eb6ce0f89b6b37887c66c10706)).\r\n-   Added `nox --session validate_functional_test_cases` session to ensure that functional test cases always adhere to the JSON schema.\r\n    -   Added `nox` session and fixed some schema file bugs ([618653a](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/618653a0888cc5e91a5fb1959cf5e04f61e5c1cf)).\r\n    -   Fixed curve intersections that did not adhere to schema ([35b158a](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/35b158a9ad4f8c0ed1d4a3cd07a8c157f33b0639)).\r\n    -   Transposed `nodes` schema for curved polygon ([8c3ca89](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/8c3ca895512a60c2fe82d8a24ab328244e3abb3f)).\r\n    -   Enable the `nox` session to run in CircleCI ([5a0a343](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/5a0a343728ac52933b1aadd3c483fb439f2e043a)).\r\n-   Updated `@slow` marker for `pytest` because it used a deprecated API ([46f8b57](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/46f8b57c8b34484236ce1bc9aa9f5ea5fc77c5df)).\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n=============\r\n\r\n-   Changing all references to Mac OS X to macOS ([b10c2fc](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/b10c2fc1af424e862143ac40d01f7baa65fc8af0), [c1c2c6b](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c1c2c6b767c40c2eb070ae599a110ecc9fb3e793), [131d17b](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/131d17be3db5546deebff953378252b12b426534)). As of 10.12, the operating system has changed its name.\r\n-   Splitting up `algorithms/helpers`. The pre-amble has been moved into the `algorithms` landing page and the geometric and algebraic helpers have been moved into separate docs. ([889c913](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/889c913436b6d01533d8eb1830717620cea725ef)).\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/tarball/0.10.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/zipball/0.10.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/releases/tag/0.10.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/19275586", "release_id": 19275586, "date_created": "2019-08-14T06:09:51Z", "date_published": "2019-08-14T06:17:32Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/13747505", "tag": "0.9.0", "name": "0.9.0", "author": {"name": "dhermes", "type": "User"}, "description": "[![PyPI link to release 0.9.0](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bezier/0.9.0.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/bezier/0.9.0/) [![Documentation for release 0.9.0](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bezier/badge/?version=0.9.0)](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/)\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n-   Documenting the C ABI `libbezier` ([4608364](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4608364e9c0a2b3888f7f661e629fceda9d9a431)). Fixed [\\#63](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/63). This [documentation](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/abi/index.html) contains a page for each \"module\" which corresponds to the underlying Fortran module. Each module documents the routines in the corresponding header file, e.g. the [surface](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/abi/surface.html) document corresponds to the `bezier/surface.h` header. Fully working C examples have been added for each routine in `bezier/curve.h` and for the enum in `bezier/status.h`.\r\n-   Adding section about environment variables to [development](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/development.html) document ([5186e24](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/5186e24a7c7eab5d65ac41ba53e3826b693fc86f)). Fixed [\\#78](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/78).\r\n-   Remove dependency on `rawgit.com` ([04d0f8d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/04d0f8d3155a22c5a048f52f75a3c6ffcc7eba69)). The website is being turned down. Fixed [\\#130](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/130).\r\n-   Renaming the \"Native Libraries\" document as \"Binary Extension\" ([f99db20](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/f99db20312bb4ba7e5943195020a8ced4be9457b)). In the process, changed most references to the \"native\" Python extension to instead call it a \"binary\" extension.\r\n-   Added a \"Cython `.pxd` [Declarations](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/python/pxd/index.html)\" document ([f99db20](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/f99db20312bb4ba7e5943195020a8ced4be9457b)). Fixed [\\#122](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/122).\r\n-   Moving all Python specific documentation under a specific URL path ([3db483b](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/3db483b58e2c5dd0f618c15fc01710ec6b1a2907)). In particular, moving\r\n    -   `/reference/...` to `/python/reference/...`\r\n    -   `/python-binary-extension.html` to `/python/binary-extension.html`\r\n    -   `/pxd/...` to `/python/pxd/...`.\r\n-   Moving all algorithm specific documentation under a specific URL path ([6e9c825](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/6e9c82501a222c95c616658e6e5e7bc00c9f4288)). In particular, moving\r\n    -   `/algorithm-helpers.html` to `/algorithms/helpers.html`\r\n    -   `/curve-curve-intersection.html` to `/algorithms/curve-curve-intersection.html`\r\n\r\nABI Changes\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n-   Added `surface.h::compute_area` helper that can be used to compute the area of both a surface and a curved polygon ([d4d7249](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/d4d7249729dffd4994df1af899084ceb89dde8fc)).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n-   Removing getters and setters for parameters used during curve-curve intersection ([2fda3ae](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/2fda3aed2818849363c425e3fce70b4bafe7e9ef)):\r\n    -   `curve_intersection.h::set_max_candidates`\r\n    -   `curve_intersection.h::get_max_candidates`\r\n-   Removing `dimension` from `curve.h::get_curvature` ([1e39c0c](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/1e39c0ce0502919d83a81902c8d9affdb6c6b892)).\r\n\r\nPython Changes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n-   Added implementation for `Surface.area` [property](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/python/reference/bezier.surface.html#bezier.surface.Surface.area) and `CurvedPolygon.area` [property](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/python/reference/bezier.curved_polygon.html#bezier.curved_polygon.CurvedPolygon.area) ([eb6077e](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/eb6077eab4f6ca0d72de6194f1789a2d0eada8b0)).\r\n\r\n### Non-Public API\r\n\r\n-   Removing getters and setters for parameters used during curve-curve intersection ([2fda3ae](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/2fda3aed2818849363c425e3fce70b4bafe7e9ef)):\r\n    - `bezier._geometric_intersection.set_max_candidates()`\r\n    - `bezier._geometric_intersection.get_max_candidates()`\r\n-   Removing cached values for `Curve.length` [property](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/python/reference/bezier.curve.html#bezier.curve.Curve.length), `Surface.area` [property](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/python/reference/bezier.surface.html#bezier.surface.Surface.area) and `Surface.is_valid` [property](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.9.0/python/reference/bezier.surface.html#bezier.surface.Surface.is_valid) ([34d48d6](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/34d48d6900963734d7fb82f13bd3f37416cc6efe)).\r\n\r\n### Build\r\n\r\n-   Renaming `libbezier.dll` shared library to `bezier.dll` on Windows ([d17a9bc](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/d17a9bcee194edc9f103734e35023d178ed8923b)). This follows the correct convention on Windows.\r\n-   Adding Python 3.7 support and making it the default version used for testing ([e368e9f](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/e368e9fd9ab31cfd818fcb9e777dff6dcbd3a7e6)).\r\n-   Dropping support for Python 3.5 ([f99db20](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/f99db20312bb4ba7e5943195020a8ced4be9457b)).\r\n-   Adding back `-march=native` for non-wheel builds ([1566019](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/1566019635b8ffb8a2e4725a2d51830351e03fa5)). This way, when installing from source (either via a local checkout or from the source distribution on PyPI) the most optimal machine instructions will be produced. Fixed [\\#99](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/99).\r\n-   Removing all traces of 32-bit support for OS X ([d7620ad](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/d7620adb862ed6f9be9d2615916f789c3c24c52f)). This was driven by a [decision](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/11625) from the NumPy maintainers.\r\n\r\n### Miscellany\r\n\r\n-   Adopted `black` [code formatter](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) ([f21b52d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/f21b52d562daf6c86ddaba326aeee8362361e20f)).\r\n-   Adding project URLs and keywords for PyPI ([cfb070d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/cfb070d651fba4e7df06216a159f623d57036f02)).\r\n-   Added 20 new surface-surface functional tests ([9fd9c1e](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/9fd9c1e26138034539e91aed04c97ec497a9e4b2)). See [\\#121](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/121) for more information.\r\n-   Removed time and memory benchmarks due to flakiness and lack of an environment that could be used for benchmarking ([6a30dc2](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/6a30dc22abefe7f7573048659b00fbcd968b8ccc)). See [\\#125](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/125) to follow discussion on re-enabling such benchmarks.\r\n-   Using `DEBUG=True` environment variable when running unit tests and other related tests ([d84dffb](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/d84dffb9d0e6fe1ee653e01cb9d4297f83aa11e0)).\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/tarball/0.9.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/zipball/0.9.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/releases/tag/0.9.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/13747505", "release_id": 13747505, "date_created": "2018-10-31T06:04:15Z", "date_published": "2018-10-31T06:07:55Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/10157642", "tag": "0.8.0", "name": "0.8.0", "author": {"name": "dhermes", "type": "User"}, "description": "[![PyPI link to release 0.8.0](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/bezier/0.8.0.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/bezier/0.8.0/) [![Documentation for release 0.8.0](https://readthedocs.org/projects/bezier/badge/?version=0.8.0)](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.0/)\r\n\r\nNew Features\r\n------------\r\n\r\n-   Adding support for surface-surface intersections that have coincident segments shared between each surface ([cfa2b93](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/cfa2b93792695b87f11ece9da1959013ecf77678), [0a9645c](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/0a9645c9a3f1df3274677ad3def3d934c590b642)). See cases:\r\n    -   4: [10Q-18Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces10Q_and_18Q.png)\r\n    -   5: [10Q-19Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces10Q_and_19Q.png)\r\n    -   43: [29Q-42Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces29Q_and_42Q.png)\r\n    -   44: [29Q-43Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces29Q_and_43Q.png)\r\n    -   45: [10Q-44Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces10Q_and_44Q.png)\r\n    -   46: [1Q-45Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces1Q_and_45Q.png)\r\n    -   47: [1Q-2C](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces1Q_and_2C.png)\r\n-   Adding support for curve-curve intersections that are also points of tangency. This was accomplished by five broad changes to the geometric intersection algorithm:\r\n    -   Checking if almost-linear curves have disjoint bounding boxes **before** intersecting the linearized segments ([05f0343](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/05f0343ca1962dbc5ab3b143b5c6fe20b87272d1)).\r\n    -   Adding a \"full\" Newton iteration for finding `B1(s) = B2(t)` when known to be near a solution. In particular, this has **special** handling for tangencies, which cause a singular Jacobian and make convergence drop from quadratic to linear and stalls out convergence early ([13a5be5](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/13a5be5d80d6a07a1a71326493baa06dbda70f13), [4bac61a](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4bac61a243b08002c4b0154d2b346cc356097eaf)).\r\n    -   Changing how \"bad\" linearized segments are handled. After subdividing to approximately linear curve segments, there were two problems which are now being handled in the same way. If the line segments connecting the subdivided curve endpoints\r\n\r\n        -   are parallel, then the algorithm failed with a `PARALLEL` status\r\n        -   intersect outside of the unit interval (for either `s` or `t`), the curve-curve candidate was rejected (a small amount, `0.5^{16}`, of \"wiggle\" room was allowed outside of `[0, 1]`).\r\n\r\n        Now both cases are handled in the same way. First, the subdivided curve segments will have a convex hull check applied (which is more strict than a bounding box check). If their convex hulls do collide, they are treated as a normal intersection of curved segments ([4457f64](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4457f64eaf28bb9fb5c91a8740cd0d618fafc3da), [fe453c3](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/fe453c3839b19ce4a85dfd0b5ad78f71a0973daf)).\r\n    -   Using the newly added \"full\" Newton's iteration for all intersections. Before, a single Newton step was applied after intersection the linearized segments ([d06430f](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/d06430fbb027eb9d62b6b724f70e62d0efb0732b)).\r\n    -   Changing how a candidate pair of `s-t` parameters is added. ([c998445](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c998445026a5487c59af17c9cbdfc9a6cf4d72c0)). In the previous implementation, a pair was considered a duplicate only if there was a difference of at most 1 [ULP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_in_the_last_place) from an existing intersection (though this could be toggled via `set_similar_ulps()`). Now, the pair is \"normalized\" so that `s` and `t` are away from `0`. For example, if `s < 2^{-10}` then we use `1 - s` instead. (This is perfectly \"appropriate\" since evaluating a B&#xe9;zier curve requires using both `s` and `1 - s`, so both values are equally relevant.) Once normalized, a relative error threshold is used.\r\n-   Four curve-curve functional test cases have gone from failing to passing:\r\n    -   11: [14-15](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/curves14_and_15.png)\r\n    -   31: [38-39](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/curves38_and_39.png)\r\n    -   43: [58-59](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/curves58_and_59.png)\r\n    -   44: [60-59](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/curves60_and_59.png)\r\n\r\n    and two surface-surface cases have as well:\r\n\r\n    -   10: [20Q-21Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces20Q_and_21Q.png)\r\n    -   42: [41Q-21Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces41Q_and_21Q.png)\r\n\r\n    In order to support the aforementioned surface-surface cases, special support for \"tangent corners\" was added ([12b0de4](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/12b0de4e4dae1d84e0681386fd312794ac8736ff)).\r\n\r\nABI Changes\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n-   Removed `BAD_TANGENT` status enum ([b89b2b1](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/b89b2b1de1726cdc9f508bd761f4c20e7d655321)). The case where that failure was issued has now been handled as an acceptable `TANGENT_BOTH` classification for surface-surface intersection points. (See the `classify_intersection()` [function](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.0/algorithm-helpers.html#bezier._surface_helpers.classify_intersection) for an example.)\r\n-   Adding `BAD_INTERIOR` status enum ([6348dc6](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/6348dc63b5d11453fa8312997429448bbdad0a3f)). (This is a **breaking** change rather than additive because it re-uses the enum value of `5` previously used by `BAD_TANGENT`.) This value is used by `interior_combine()` in the case that the curved polygon intersection(s) cannot be determined from the edge-edge intersections for a given surface-surface pair. See [#101](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/101).\r\n-   Removed `PARALLEL` status enum ([fe453c3](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/fe453c3839b19ce4a85dfd0b5ad78f71a0973daf)). Now when doing geometric curve-curve intersection, parallel linearized segments are handled by checking if the convex hulls collide and then (if they do) using a modified Newton iteration to converge to a root.\r\n-   Adding `BAD_MULTIPLICITY` status enum ([fe453c3](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/fe453c3839b19ce4a85dfd0b5ad78f71a0973daf)). (This is a **breaking** change rather than additive because it re-uses the enum value of `1` previously used by `PARALLEL`.) This is used when Newton's method fails to converge to either a simple intersection or a tangent intersection. Such failures to converge, when already starting near an intersection, may be caused by one of:\r\n    -   The intersection was of multiplicity greater than 2\r\n    -   The curves don't actually intersect, though they come very close\r\n    -   Numerical issues caused the iteration to leave the region of convergence\r\n-   Removed `ulps_away()` ([c998445](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c998445026a5487c59af17c9cbdfc9a6cf4d72c0)).\r\n-   Removed `set_similar_ulps()` and `get_similar_ulps()` ([c998445](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c998445026a5487c59af17c9cbdfc9a6cf4d72c0)).\r\n\r\n### Surface Changes\r\n\r\n-   Added `SINGULAR` status enum for cases when a linear system can't be solved due to a singular matrix ([4457f64](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4457f64eaf28bb9fb5c91a8740cd0d618fafc3da)).\r\n-   Adding `status` as a return value in `newton_refine_curve_intersect()`. This way, when the Jacobian is singular (which happens at points of tangency), the `SINGULAR` status can be returned ([4457f64](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4457f64eaf28bb9fb5c91a8740cd0d618fafc3da)). The old behavior would've resulted in a division by zero.\r\n\r\n### Non-Public API\r\n\r\n-   Adding custom linear solver for the `2 x 2` case ([a3fb476](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/a3fb476cf9a82a34754bdd9b9881fbe857883d57)). This is modelled after `dgesv` from LAPACK.\r\n\r\nPython Changes\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n-   (**Bug fix**) The `0.7.0` release broke `Surface.plot()` and `CurvedPolygon.plot()` (when the nodes were transposed, the plotting helpers were not correctly updated). The `add_patch()` helper was fixed to account for the changes in data layout ([80bfaaa](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/80bfaaa74219f9053585aa8970131018baa516d1)).\r\n-   Added custom `UnsupportedDegree` [exception](http://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.8.0/reference/bezier.html#bezier.UnsupportedDegree) to be used by routines that have implementations that are hard-coded for specific degrees ([87a1f21](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/87a1f2171f6b810516544ff1691856d7fadfa12f)). See [#103](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/issues/103).\r\n-   Removed `ulps_away()` ([c998445](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c998445026a5487c59af17c9cbdfc9a6cf4d72c0)).\r\n-   Removed `set_similar_ulps()` and `get_similar_ulps()` ([c998445](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c998445026a5487c59af17c9cbdfc9a6cf4d72c0)).\r\n\r\n### Non-Public API\r\n\r\n-   Returning `coincident` flag from curve-curve `all_intersections` ([ebe6617](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/ebe66178d0ab6f359ba206ded7b5d629d849955c)).\r\n-   Adding a `TANGENT_BOTH` classification for surface-surface intersection points that are interior to both surfaces at the point of tangency ([b89b2b1](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/b89b2b1de1726cdc9f508bd761f4c20e7d655321)). This previously failed with a `NotImplementedError`.\r\n-   Added `COINCIDENT` classification for surface-surface intersection points that occur on a segment that is coincident on an edges of each surface ([8b1c59d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/8b1c59d2b48281d38275af6c5b6e11c1699b92c6)). Such points previously failed classification because they were interpreted as being tangent and having the same curvature (because the segments are identical).\r\n-   Added a `COINCIDENT_UNUSED` classification ([cfa2b93](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/cfa2b93792695b87f11ece9da1959013ecf77678)) for cases where coincident segments are moving in opposite directions (i.e. the surfaces don't share a common interior). For example see case 44 ([29Q-43Q](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/blob/0.8.0/docs/images/surfaces29Q_and_43Q.png)).\r\n-   Adding custom linear solver for the `2 x 2` case ([764e56d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/764e56db5bb4987d31e3c9f5fbabbe6564d6e0c0)). This is modelled after `dgesv` from LAPACK.\r\n-   Adding some support for B&#xe9;zier clipping algorithm ([fbed62d](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/fbed62df305b8c2679ff260bba4f57d414e79a77), [ada4ea3](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/ada4ea34bf31cff5cc34491d6689f0f3a2b9f0a1)).

This is a much \"finer\" check than using the \"blunt\" bounding box check.\r\n    -   If the convex hull refinement fails, checks if the curves are coincident, i.e. different segments / parameterizations along the same algebraic curve. This is done by using the `Curve.locate()` [function](https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.7.0/reference/bezier.curve.html#bezier.curve.Curve.locate) to try to project each of the four endpoints onto the other curve and then re-parameterizing each curve onto a common interval.\r\n\r\nData Structures\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n-   Storing `xy`-points as columns (rather than rows). This was a **very** large and breaking change, started in [b44af8c](https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/b44af8c3d590add947f905f2bc016af7272fc8e0).

When one module updated the global, the other module never saw the update (because it was a different copy).\r\n\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/tarball/0.6.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/zipball/0.6.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/releases/tag/0.6.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/9354006", "release_id": 9354006, "date_created": "2018-01-23T18:17:36Z", "date_published": "2018-01-23T18:25:37Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/9218853", "tag": "0.6.1", "name": "0.6.1", "author": {"name": "dhermes", "type": "User"}, "description": "PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/bezier/0.6.1/\r\nDocs: https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.6.1/\r\n\r\n## Python Changes\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n- Noting that `Surface.intersect()` can return a list of either `CurvedPolygon` or `Surface` instances ([`16e77d7`][0.6.1-5]).\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Removing `IntersectionClassification` enum from `_status.pxd` ([`4da969e`][0.6.1-4]).\r\n\r\n### Non-Public API\r\n\r\n- Adding getters and setters for parameters used during curve-curve intersection ([`ef4ebc0`][0.6.1-7]):\r\n  - `bezier._geometric_intersection.set_max_candidates()`\r\n  - `bezier._geometric_intersection.get_max_candidates()`\r\n  - `bezier._geometric_intersection.set_similar_ulps()`\r\n  - `bezier._geometric_intersection.get_similar_ulps()`\r\n\r\n## ABI Changes\r\n\r\n### Surface Changes\r\n\r\n- Switching from `int` to an actual enum for relevant functions with output values that are enums:\r\n  - In `surface_intersection.h::surface_intersections`, `contained` is now a `SurfaceContained` ([`0a9c0c3`][0.6.1-3]) and `status` is now a `Status` ([`c356c32`][0.6.1-2])\r\n  - In `curve_intersection.h::bbox_intersect`, `enum_` is now a `BoxIntersectionType` ([`ef856af`][0.6.1-1])\r\n  - In `curve_intersection.h::curve_intersections`, `status` is now a `Status` ([`ef856af`][0.6.1-1])\r\n- Adding getters and setters for parameters used during curve-curve intersection ([`ef4ebc0`][0.6.1-7]):\r\n  - `curve_intersection.h::set_max_candidates`\r\n  - `curve_intersection.h::get_max_candidates`\r\n  - `curve_intersection.h::set_similar_ulps`\r\n  - `curve_intersection.h::get_similar_ulps`\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- Removing inputs `curve_start / curve_end` and outputs `true_start / true_end` in `curve.h::specialize_curve` ([`959c547`][0.6.1-6])\r\n\r\n[0.6.1-1]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/ef856aff4e87ab0620d1ce28e7fdbd3395c8ec38\r\n[0.6.1-2]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/c356c32b33781b03785b8868f59efd6ad3076a51\r\n[0.6.1-3]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/0a9c0c3736e95deedeecb8d10284c92ebd39469d\r\n[0.6.1-4]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/4da969e65cec37ca5c0a56e956e7a1546be24236\r\n[0.6.1-5]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/16e77d74c526a216c0c2a74d4536cd1d9f93bcff\r\n[0.6.1-6]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/959c5473e97e80b1b4e4fd0109f7e79cf1dc36eb\r\n[0.6.1-7]: https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/commit/ef4ebc0654d863610df982f218449b27bd135afc\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/tarball/0.6.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/zipball/0.6.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/dhermes/bezier/releases/tag/0.6.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/9218853", "release_id": 9218853, "date_created": "2018-01-12T20:40:42Z", "date_published": "2018-01-12T20:44:25Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/dhermes/bezier/releases/9173815", "tag": "0.6.0", "name": "0.6.0", "author": {"name": "dhermes", "type": "User"}, "description": "PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/bezier/0.6.0/\r\nDocs: https://bezier.readthedocs.io/en/0.6.0/\r\n\r\n## Performance Optimizations\r\n\r\n- Added recommended performance flags for `gfortran` based on [recommendations][0.6.0-3] on `fortran90.org` ([`3877982`][0.6.0-22]).\r\n  - Extensions can be compiled in debug mode by setting `DEBUG=True` ([`b62460b`][0.6.0-62]).\r\n  - Setting `BEZIER_NO_EXTENSIONS=True` will build pure-Python modules only ([`3f6280c`][0.6.0-25])\r\n- Added [QUADPACK][0.6.0-86] to use in `curve.f90::compute_length` ([`985a4c0`][0.6.0-53]).\r\n- Implemented curve-curve intersection completely in Fortran (e.g. [`4a8f801`][0.6.0-28]) which resulted in a 10x speedup when called from Python. Also implemented surface-surface intersection completely in Fortran, resulting in a 3x speedup.\r\n\r\n## Python Changes\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- Added `CurvedPolygon._metadata` to track where edges originated, e.g. from a surface-surface intersection ([`871d23d`][0.6.0-45]). This is used for sanity checking in functional tests ([`e253da2`][0.6.0-78]).\r\n- Made speedup checks specific to the module, not all four. I.e. `bezier._HAS_SPEEDUP` was dropped in favor of five members, e.g. `_HAS_CURVE_SPEEDUP` ([`d798f66`][0.6.0-73]).\r\n- Added `bezier.__author__` and [`bezier.__version__`][0.6.0-87] attributes.\r\n- Added [`bezier.get_dll()`][0.6.0-88] for Windows ([`699e39b`][0.6.0-34]).\r\n- Added `bezier/__config__.py` that adds `libbezier` to `%PATH%` on Windows ([`8538af4`][0.6.0-43]).\r\n- Fortran / Cython speedups added:\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::subdivide_nodes`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::newton_refine`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::locate_point`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::elevate_nodes`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::get_curvature`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::reduce_pseudo_inverse`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::full_reduce`\r\n  - `_curve_speedup.pyx::compute_length`\r\n  - `_curve_intersection_speedup.pyx::all_intersections`\r\n  - `_curve_intersection_speedup.pyx::free_curve_intersections_workspace`\r\n  - `_helpers_speedup.pyx::contains_nd`\r\n  - `_helpers_speedup.pyx::vector_close`\r\n  - `_helpers_speedup.pyx::in_interval`\r\n  - `_helpers_speedup.pyx::ulps_away`\r\n  - `_surface_speedup.pyx::specialize_surface`\r\n  - `_surface_speedup.pyx::subdivide_nodes`\r\n  - `_surface_speedup.pyx::compute_edge_nodes`\r\n  - `_surface_intersection_speedup.pyx::newton_refine`\r\n  - `_surface_intersection_speedup.pyx::locate_point`\r\n  - `_surface_intersection_speedup.pyx::surface_intersections`\r\n  - `_surface_intersection_speedup.pyx::free_surface_intersections_workspace`\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes\r\n\r\n- [`Curve.intersect()`][0.6.0-89] returns `s-t` parameters rather than `x-y` values ([`c309998`][0.6.0-68]).\r\n- [`Surface.intersect()`][0.6.0-90] returns a list with a single `Surface` when one of the two surfaces is contained in the other ([`05b1fd9`][0.6.0-6]).\r\n- [`Surface.is_valid`][0.6.0-91] will only return `True` if the map `B(s, t)` determined by the surface has everywhere positive Jacobian. Previously a negative Jacobian was also allowed ([`260fb51`][0.6.0-1]).\r\n- Removed data members from `Curve`:\r\n  - `edge_index` ([`b969488`][0.6.0-63])\r\n  - `next_edge` ([`28619e8`][0.6.0-16])\r\n  - `previous_edge` ([`28619e8`][0.6.0-16])\r\n  - `root` ([`db427f9`][0.6.0-75])\r\n  - `start` ([`39ee98b`][0.6.0-23])\r\n  - `end` ([`39ee98b`][0.6.0-23])\r\n- Removed data members from `Surface`:\r\n  - `base_x` ([`dea75e3`][0.6.0-2])\r\n  - `base_y` ([`dea75e3`][0.6.0-2])\r\n  - `width` ([`dea75e3`][0.6.0-2])\r\n- Remove `dimension` argument in `_curve_speedup.pyx::elevate_nodes` since it can be inferred from `nodes` ([`06501c5`][0.6.0-7]).\r\n\r\n## ABI Changes\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\n- Fully implemented curve-curve intersection (as `curve_intersection.h::curve_intersections`) and surface-surface intersection (as `surface_intersection.h::surface_intersections`) at the ABI level.\r\n- Added the `surface_intersection.h` header file and implementations for the described functions ([`fafd9ff`][0.6.0-84]).\r\n- Newly added functions\r\n  - `curve.h::subdivide_nodes_curve` ([`efb3ce6`][0.6.0-82])\r\n  - `curve.h::newton_refine_curve` ([`2257344`][0.6.0-15])\r\n  - `curve.h::locate_point_curve` ([`2121101`][0.6.0-14], [`32b0fa9`][0.6.0-20])\r\n  - `curve.h::elevate_nodes_curve` ([`b03fc28`][0.6.0-60])\r\n  - `curve.h::get_curvature` ([`69cb2f8`][0.6.0-35])\r\n  - `curve.h::reduce_pseudo_inverse` ([`7c3db17`][0.6.0-39])\r\n  - `curve.h::full_reduce` ([`4abd309`][0.6.0-29])\r\n  - `curve.h::compute_length` ([`985a4c0`][0.6.0-53], [`7e71b20`][0.6.0-40])\r\n  - `curve_intersection.h::curve_intersections` ([`c92f98d`][0.6.0-96])\r\n  - `curve_intersection.h::free_curve_intersections_workspace` ([`c92f98d`][0.6.0-96])\r\n  - `helpers.h::contains_nd` ([`36f4b5e`][0.6.0-21])\r\n  - `helpers.h::vector_close` ([`9f3716a`][0.6.0-55])\r\n  - `helpers.h::in_interval` ([`3c0af5d`][0.6.0-24])\r\n  - `helpers.h::ulps_away` ([`0197237`][0.6.0-4])\r\n  - `surface.h::specialize_surface` ([`eb8693e`][0.6.0-81], [`fcd5bad`][0.6.0-85])\r\n  - `surface.h::subdivide_nodes_surface` ([`6027210`][0.6.0-32], [`4fc5f2a`][0.6.0-30], [`8beb1ac`][0.6.0-47], [`0b2b1f3`][0.6.0-8], [`d27b86f`][0.6.0-70], [`88c302b`][0.6.0-46])\r\n  - `surface.h::compute_edge_nodes` ([`2d02590`][0.6.0-17], [`f86649a`][0.6.0-83])\r\n  - `surface_intersection.h::newton_refine_surface` ([`93c288d`][0.6.0-50])\r\n  - `surface_intersection.h::locate_point_surface` ([`325ea47`][0.6.0-19], [`ca134e6`][0.6.0-69], [`bf69852`][0.6.0-65])\r\n  - `surface_intersection.h::surface_intersections`\r\n  - `surface_intersection.h::free_surface_intersections_workspace`\r\n- Added [`status.h`][0.6.0-97] with an enum for failure states. Each Fortran procedure that returns a status documents the possible values and if each value is set directly or by a called procedure ([`9fc8575`][0.6.0-56], [`c2accf7`][0.6.0-67]).\r\n\r\n###

`curve_intersection.h::newton_refine_intersect` to `newton_refine_curve_intersect` ([`a055525`][0.6.0-57])\r\n- Replaced `degree` with `num_nodes (== degree + 1)` in functions that operate on curves:\r\n  - `curve.h::evaluate_curve_barycentric` ([`13eacdd`][0.6.0-10])\r\n  - `curve.h::evaluate_multi` ([`962c288`][0.6.0-52])\r\n  - `curve.h::specialize_curve` ([`ac86233`][0.6.0-59])\r\n  -

an exception. This allows the implicitization approach to use it without having to use exceptions for flow-control. (Fixes [#22][5].)\r\n-   Switching Fortran speedups from `f2py` to Cython (this is because `f2py` artificially limits the feature set of Fortran, i.e. user defined types)\r\n-   Moving some more code to Fortran (e.g. `bbox_line_intersect()` [`3dcf640`][11])\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n-   Making Fortran features available outside of Python (see [Native Libraries][1])\r\n    -   C headers for each Fortran module (via [`bezier.get_include()`][2])\r\n    -   Cython `.pxd` declarations for all Fortran modules\r\n    -   `libbezier` static library (via [`bezier.get_lib()`][3])\r\n-   Implementing [`bezier_roots()`][13] polynomial root solver for polynomials written in Bernstein basis. ([`0dd6369`][12])\r\n\r\n## Miscellany\r\n-   Getting `bezier` [published][10] in the Journal of Open Source Science (JOSS). See [review][9]. ([`e6c4536`][7] and [`975ac6b`][8])\r\n-   Updating error message for `locate()` methods and adding a note that `locate()` / `evaluate*()` are (essentially) inverses. H/T to @pdknsk [#36][4]\r\n-   Using Fortran-contiguous arrays in `_check_non_simple()`. ([`b06c78e`][6])\r\n-   Moving most of `Curve.subdivide()` and `Surface.subdivide()` logic into helpers. This is part of an effort to make all helpers take low-level data types rather than `Curve`s, `Surface`s, etc. ([`34515bd`][14] and [`1fc80e5`][15])\r\n-   Split `speedup.f90` into submodules `curve.f90`, `surface.f90`, etc. ([`75349b7`][16], [`dfd6bba`][17], [`7096a9d`][18], [`c326c00`][19])\r\n-   Adding `BEZIER_JOURNAL` option to `setup.py`. This stores a record of compiler commands invoked during installation. See [Native Libraries][1] for more details.

(Making sure to use this switch during \"internal\" computation.)\r\n-   Making sure NumPy arrays are Fortran-contiguous as often as possible (e.g. snippets and source, via `np.asfortranarray()`). This is to avoid (and emphasize) a non-trivial overhead when passing a C-contiguous array to a Fortran function. ([`03a7242`][15], [`6064e4c`][16], [`f1804f4`][17])\r\n-   Using Horner's method in `Curve.evaluate_multi()` and `Surface.evaluate_barycentric()`, rather than inferior (sometimes non-vectorized) approaches ([`dee8181`][18], [`2611e64`][19])\r\n-   Made surface-surface intersection more resilient / lenient for corner intersections. For \"nearby\" intersections, parameter values can be rounded to `0` or `1`. ([`4a8458c`][25])\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n-   [Adding][23] optional `strategy` argument (one of geometric or algebraic) to [`Surface.intersect()`][24]\r\n    -   Added \"algebraic\" [`IntersectionStrategy`][20] via curve [implicitization][27] ([reference][28])\r\n-   Adding [`Curve.reduce_()`][21] which acts as a partial inverse to [`Curve.elevate()`][31]. It is only a complete inverse when a curve is degree-elevated, otherwise it returns the \"best\" reduced form (in the least squares sense).\r\n\r\n## Interface Changes\r\n-   (**Breaking change**) [Removing][5] `show` keyword from [`Curve.plot()`][2], [`Surface.plot()`][3] and [`CurvedPolygon.plot()`][4]\r\n-   [Adding][32] `color` keyword to [`Curve.plot()`][2]\r\n-   [Adding][26] `alpha` keyword to [`Curve.plot()`][2]\r\n-   (**Breaking change**) [Splitting][6] the [`Surface.evaluate_multi()`][7] method into [`Surface.evaluate_barycentric_multi()`][8] and [`Surface.evaluate_cartesian_multi()`][9]\r\n-   [Adding][22] `__dict__` helpers on `Curve`, `CurvedPolygon` and `Surface`.
