towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or\n advances\n* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic\n address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the
