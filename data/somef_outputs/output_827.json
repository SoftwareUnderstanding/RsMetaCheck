Please submit your pull requests to `development`.\n\n## Repository structure\n\nThis repository is structured as a standard R package\nfollowing the conventions outlined in the [Writing R\nextensions](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual.\nA few additional files are provided that are not part of the built\nR package and are listed in `.Rbuildignore`, such as `.travis.yml`,\nwhich is used for continuous testing and integration.\n\n## Code\n\nAll code for this package is found in `R/`. All functions should be thoroughly\ndocumented with `roxygen2` notation; see Documentation. Code should\nconform to the rOpenSci [Style guide](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/packaging_guide.md).\n\n## Testing\n\nAny new feature or bug-fix should include a unit-test demonstrating the\nchange.  Unit tests follow the `testthat` framework with files in\n`tests/testthat`.  Please make sure that the testing suite passes\nbefore issuing a pull request.  This can be done by running `check()`\nfrom the `devtools` package, which will also check for consistent\ndocumentation, etc.\n\n\nThis package uses the [travis](https://github.com/craigcitro/r-travis)\ncontinuous testing mechanism for R to ensure that the test suite is run\non each push to Github.  An icon at the top of the README.md indicates\nwhether or not the tests are currently passing.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll of the function documentation is generated automatically.\nPlease do not edit any of the documentation files in `man/`\nor the `NAMESPACE`.  Instead, construct the appropriate\n[roxygen2](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen) documentation in the\nfunction files in `R/` themselves.  The documentation is then generated\nby running the `document()` function from the `devtools` package.  Please\nconsult the [Advanced R programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) guide if\nthis workflow is unfamiliar to you.  Note that functions should include\nexamples in the documentation. Please use `\\dontrun` for examples that\ntake more than a few seconds to execute or require an internet connection.\n\nLikewise, the README.md file in the base directory should not be edited\ndirectly.  This file is created automatically from code that runs the\nexamples shown, helping to ensure that they are functioning as advertised\nand consistent with the package README vignette.  Instead, edit the\n`README.Rmd` source file in `manuscripts` and run `make` to build\nthe README.\n\n## General Development Goals & Guidelines\n\n1. High-level functions requiring little to no knowledge of EML or R.\n2. Functions to auto-detect metadata from data entities.\n3. Check user inputs for valid entries.\n4. Errors and warnings should guide users to solutions.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThese contributing guidelines are based on those of the [rOpenSci EML project](https://github.com/ropensci/EML/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EDIorg/EMLassemblyline/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Please contribute!
