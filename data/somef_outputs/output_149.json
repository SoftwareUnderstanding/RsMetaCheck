Consumers of the data package can verify how\n  the processing was done, increasing confidence in your data. \n- It automates construction of the documentation and maintains a data\n  set version and an md5 fingerprint of each data object in the package.\n  If the data changes and the package is rebuilt, the data version is\n  automatically updated.\n \n", "original_header": "Challenges"}, "confidence": 0.9546597201569821, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/DataPackageR/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "See this [rOpenSci blog\npost](https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/09/18/datapackager/) on how to\nbuild data packages interactively using DataPackageR.

If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We are using the Git commit workflow found here: \nhttps://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow  \n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR) and keep\nissues addressed to one issue per branch.  \n*  Look at the git workflow checks before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the DataPackageR project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

R\u2019s packaging\n  infrastructure promotes unit testing, documentation, a reproducible\n  build system, and has many other benefits. Coopting it for packaging\n  data sets is a natural fit.\n\n- **Collaboration.**\n\n  A data set packaged in R is easy to distribute and share among\n  collaborators, and is easy to install and use. All the hard work\n  you\u2019ve put into documenting and standardizing the tidy data set comes\n  right along with the data package.\n\n- **Documentation.**\n\n  R\u2019s package system allows us to document data objects. What\u2019s more,\n  the `roxygen2` package makes this very easy to do with [markup\n  tags](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html). That documentation is the\n  equivalent of a data dictionary and can be extremely valuable when\n  returning to a project after a period of time.\n\n- **Convenience.**\n\n  Data pre-processing can be time consuming, depending on the data type\n  and raw data sets may be too large to share conveniently in a packaged\n  format. Packaging and sharing the small, tidied data saves the users\n  computing time and time spent waiting for downloads.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Why package data sets?", "parent_header": ["DataPackageR", "What problems does DataPackageR tackle?"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/DataPackageR/main/README.Rmd"}], "faq": [{"result": {"value": "You have diverse raw data sets that you need to preprocess and tidy in\norder to:\n\n- Perform data analysis\n- Write a report\n- Publish a paper\n- Share data with colleagues and collaborators\n- Save time in the future when you return to this project but have\n  forgotten all about what you did.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "What problems does DataPackageR tackle?", "parent_header": ["DataPackageR"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/DataPackageR/main/README.Rmd"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "``` r\nlibrary(DataPackageR)\n\n# Let's reproducibly package up\n# the cars in the mtcars dataset\n# with speed > 20.\n# Our dataset will be called cars_over_20.\n# There are three steps:\n\n# 1.
