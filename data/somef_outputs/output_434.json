Functionality of BaseProvider remains the same.\n* All **Parent providers**  will error when you try to init them.\n* Locales inherit from a **Parent provider**, giving us the ability to customize \nevery locale (when needed) without changing the logic for all locales.\n* Every provider (when it has locales) has at least an en_US locale.\n* Ability to create specific functions for your locale specific provider. Example: Are first and last names not used in your locale? you can now create specific functions for your locale. Example: the Japanese locale now has first_kana_name _(for example \u30d2\u30ed\u30ad)_, last_kana_name functionality next to the romanized names. \n* all locales have labels so they are connected in the docs. You can now see all NZ Providers in one overview.\n\n\n### REMOVED\n* Removed the siren functionality from CompanyProvider (it was only used in the fr_FR locale and we can provide phone numbers with the PhoneProvider.\n\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n* All locale specific Providers fall back to locale `en_US` if there is no version of this locale provider and will warn you if they do.\n* Reworked development vignette\n* added locale-templates for addresses, colors, company, internet, job, lorem,person, phonenumber and ssn. \n* added the following functionality to fraudster: `address`, `company`, `element`, `element_symbol`, `file_name`, `email`, `url`, `mac_address`, `lorem_paragraph`, `ssn`\n* add print method so the providers print nicely in the console.\n* All data fields are moved to `private` to reduce visual clutter.\n* Added docs for languages like `czech-language` `turkish-language`.\n* modified tests so they work for test_that version 3\n\n### BUG FIXES\n* None\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/tarball/v0.6.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/zipball/v0.6.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/charlatan/releases/tag/v0.6.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/releases/180642059", "release_id": 180642059, "date_created": "2024-10-17T04:45:02Z", "date_published": "2024-10-18T10:41:38Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/releases/120968378", "tag": "v0.5.1", "name": "v0.5.1", "author": {"name": "RMHogervorst", "type": "User"}, "description": "# charlatan 0.5.1\r\nChanged maintainer of the package to RMHogervorst\r\n\r\n## NEW FEATURES\r\nadded a SSN number generation process for en_US, addition by Neal Furtz (@nfultz)\r\n\r\n## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\nFixed a failing test on r-devel\r\n\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/tarball/v0.5.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/zipball/v0.5.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/charlatan/releases/tag/v0.5.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/releases/120968378", "release_id": 120968378, "date_created": "2023-09-13T13:37:11Z", "date_published": "2023-09-14T05:04:41Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/charlatan/releases/23093985", "tag": "v0.4.0", "name": "charlatan v0.4.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* gains new vignette \"Contributing to charlatan\" -
