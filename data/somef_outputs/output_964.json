developer's guide of cuIBM!\n\n## Adding new features and fixing bugs\n\nAll new features and bug fixes must go through a pull-request review procedure.\nIf you want to add something to cuIBM, please fork the Barbagroup's [cuIBM](https://github.com/barbagroup/cuIBM) repository, make your changes on your fork, and then open a pull-request with your changes against the main cuIBM repository.\n\nFor new features and minor bugs (with small impact), the base branch of the pull-request should be the `develop` branch of the main repository.\n(The `develop` branch will be merged into the `master` one once we are ready for a new release of cuIBM.)\n\nFor major bugs, the base branch should be the `master` one of the main repository; it will be considered as a hotfix (bugfix) and a new version of cuIBM will be released as soon as possible by the maintainers with the micro number incremented.\n\nNew features should come with some kind of test or example to verify and/or validate the implementation.\nFor example, the Markdown file [`doc/flapping.md`](https://github.com/barbagroup/cuIBM/blob/master/doc/flapping.md) provides a detailed description of a flapping-wing simulation at Reynolds number 75; it serves as validation for the case of a single moving body (using the immersed-boundary projection method) and compares cuIBM results with ones from other studies (experimental and computational).\n\n\n## Reporting bugs and requesting new features\n\nTo report bugs, request new features, or simply ask questions, please open a GitHub issue on the Barbagroup's cuIBM repository.\n\n\n## Writing documentation\n\nNew classes, methods, functions, and namespaces must be documented with Doxygen-style doctrings.\n(See [here](https://github.com/barbagroup/cuIBM/blob/master/src/solvers/NavierStokesSolver.h) for reference.)\n\nTo locally check the Doxygen documentation, use the command-line:\n\n    > make doc\n\nand open the file `doc/html/index.html` in your favorite browser.\n\nYou should also add code documentation whenever necessary; it will greatly help other developers to review your new features and bug fixes.\n\nFor new features, user's documentation must also be written.\nFor this purpose, we use Markdown files that are located in the `doc` folder of the root directory of cuIBM.\n\nThe Wiki pages and Doxygen API documentation are up-to-date with the latest release of cuIBM, which should also be the latest commit on the `master` branch.\n\nOnce a new new release is drafted, we will merge the `doc` folder into the Wiki of cuIBM and the API documentation will be merged into the branch `gh-pages`.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":

(~4 minutes on a K40 GPU.)\n* `cylinderRe100`: flow over a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 100. The\ninitial flow field has an asymmetric perturbation that triggers instability in\nthe flow and vortex shedding is observed in the wake.\n* `cylinderRe150`: flow over a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 150. The\ninitial flow field has an asymmetric perturbation that triggers instability in\nthe flow and vortex shedding is observed in the wake.\n* `cylinderRe200`: flow over a circular cylinder at Reynolds number 150. The\ninitial flow field has an asymmetric perturbation that triggers instability in\nthe flow and vortex shedding is observed in the wake.\n* `cylinderRe550`: initial flow over an impulsively started cylinder at\nReynolds number 550. (~4 minutes on a K40 GPU.)\n* `cylinderRe3000`: initial flow over an impulsively started cylinder at\nReynolds number 3000. (~25 minutes on a K40 GPU.)\n* `flappingRe75`: flow around a flapping foil at Reynolds number 75. (~10 hours on a K20 GPU.)\n* `heavingRe500`: flow around heaving foil at Reynolds number 500.\n* `oscillatingCylindersRe100`: flow across two oscillating cylinders at Reynolds number 100. (~25 minutes on a K20 GPU.)\n* `snakeRe1000AoA30`: flow around the cross-section of a gliding snake forming a 30-degree angle of attack with the freestream at Reynolds number 1000. (~65 hours on a K20 GPU.)\n* `snakeRe1000AoA35`: flow around the cross-section of a gliding snake forming a 35-degree angle of attack with the freestream at Reynolds number 1000. (~65 hours on a K20 GPU.)\n* `snakeRe1000AoA30`: flow around the cross-section of a gliding snake forming a 30-degree angle of attack with the freestream at Reynolds number 2000. (~65 hours on a K20 GPU.)\n* `snakeRe1000AoA35`: flow around the cross-section of a gliding snake forming a 35-degree angle of attack with the freestream at Reynolds number 2000. (~65 hours on a K20 GPU.)\n\nTo run any of the examples listed above:\n\n    > cd $CUIBM_DIR\n    > make <examplename>\n\nor change directory to the corresponding example's folder and\n\n    > cuibm\n\nThe biggest cases (for the gliding snake) requires a GPU device with at least 4GB of memory.\n\nTo test an example on a smaller number of time steps, you can change the value of the parameters `nt` in the input file `simParams.yaml` of the example directory. (Note that the flow solution is saved every `nsave` time steps which value can be changed in the same input file.)\n\n---\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "List of examples", "parent_header": ["cuIBM - A GPU-based Immersed Boundary Method code"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barbagroup/cuIBM/master/README.md"}], "contact": [{"result": {"value": "Please e-mail [Anush Krishnan](mailto:k.anush@gmail.com)\nor [Olivier Mesnard](mailto:mesnardo@gwu.edu), if you have any\nquestions, suggestions or feedback.\n\nTo report bugs, please use the GitHub issue tracking system.
