(#409)\r\n* Internal `Request` and `VcrResponse` classes are no longer exported and have been removed.\r\n* `HTTPInteractionList` is no longer exported; it's an internal implementation detail.\r\n* The `uri_parser` option is no longer supported.\r\n* `vcr_configuration(allow_http_connections_when_no_cassette)` is no longer supported. It hasn't worked for a while.\r\n* `vcr_configuration(quiet = FALSE)` is no longer supported. If you need more information about what's happening, turn on logging.\r\n* `str_splitter()` has been removed; it was accidentally exported as it's not part of the core vcrs API.\r\n* `cassettes()` are now a stack. The most important consequence of this is that `eject_cassette()` can only remove the most recently inserted cassette.\r\n* `as.cassette()` has been removed. It's not used, and not needed anymore.\r\n* `cassettes()` no longer has `on_disk` or `verb` arguments and now only ever lists currently active cassettes.\r\n\r\n## NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* The default request matcher now uses method, uri, and body if present.\r\n* New function `local_cassette()` to create a local cassette that is used for the current function scope and ejected on exit - this is now the suggested way to use vcr in tests.\r\n* New functions `vcr_configure_log()` and `local_vcr_configure_log()` to configure logging; the former sets logging for the R session, while the latter sets logging for the current function scope.\r\n* `local_casette()` and `use_cassette()` set env vars `VCR_IS_RECORDING` and `VCR_IS_REPLAYING` and provide helpers `is_recording()` and `is_replaying()`. (#520)\r\n* New `current_cassette_recording()` and `current_cassette_replaying()` tell you if the current cassette is recording or replaying (or neither or both). (#505)\r\n* New `vcr_last_request()` and `vcr_last_response()` to get last request and response respectively (#488).\r\n* The vignettes have been updated for all the new changes and generally polished.\r\n* New `insert_example_cassette()` makes it easier to use vcr in examples (#309).\r\n* New `setup_knitr()` makes it easier to use vcr from within a vignette (#308).\r\n* The `Authorization` header is never written to disk. (#450)\r\n* The request body and headers are only written to disk if actually used for matching (#417).\r\n* Writing files to disk now works with out any additional config. Files are saved in a directory called `{cassette-name}-files` inside of the cassette directory. You can override this default with `vrc_configure(write_disk_path)`.\r\n* New `body_json` request matcher that compares the parsed JSON. This both ignores differences in the textual representation of the JSON and gives more informative messages when requests don't match. (#421)\r\n* Raw bodies are now automatically gzipped before being converted to base64 (#343).\r\n* The default path is now `tests/testthat/_vcr`. This should not affect existing packages that used `use_vcr()` because these set up a helper that sets the default directory with `vcr_configure()` (#395).\r\n* New function `local_vcr_configure()` allows you to temporarily affect vcr configuration. (#285)\r\n* New serializer option `qs2`, using the `qs2` package, generating compressed binary cassette files that are smaller than YAML or JSON files. `compressed` will have the greatest proportional disk space savings as cassettes have more data in them.

You can use this serializer by setting globally `vcr_configure(serialize_with=\"json\")` or per cassette `use_cassette(..., serialize_with=\"json\")`. The JSON serializer uses `jsonlite` under the hood. Note that we by default do not write JSON to disk preserving newlines; that is the JSON is all on one line. You can use pretty printing by setting `json_pretty` in `vcr_configure()`. As part of this change, factored out new R6 class `Serializer` from which both JSON and YAML serializers inherit (#32)\r\n* Gains two new configuration options for managing secrets: `filter_request_headers` and `filter_response_headers`. These are implemented differently than `filter_sensitive_data`. The two new filters do simple value replacement or complete removal of request or response headers, whereas `filter_sensitive_data` uses regex to replace strings anywhere in the stored request/response. See the \"Configure vcr\" vignette for details (#182)\r\n* request matching: `host` and `path` now work (#177) (see also #70)\r\n* In previous versions of vcr the `insert_cassette()`/`eject_cassette()` workflow did not work because the webmockr triggers required only worked when using `use_cassette()`. This has been fixed now so you can use `use_cassette()`, passing a code block to it, or run `insert_cassette()` then run any code, then when finished run `eject_cassette()`.  (#24) thanks @Robsteranium for the nudge, may not have fixed this without it\r\n* improve debugging experience: new vignette \"Debugging your tests that use vcr\", including new function `vcr_test_path()` - which is now used in `use_vcr()` so that the correct path to tests is used when running tests both interactively and non-interactively (#192) (#193)\r\n* Dependencies: dropped `lazyeval` from Imports; `withr` added to Suggests; minimum `webmockr` version now `v0.7.4`\r\n* In README, point to rOpenSci code of conduct rather than file in repo\r\n* Gains function `skip_if_vcr_off()` to use in tests to skip a test if vcr is turned off (#191) (#195)\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* slight factor out of some code in YAML serializer to use elsewhere (#203) (#204)\r\n* serializers: drop `$deserialize_string()` method as was not used - rename `$deserialize_path()` method to just `$deserialize()` (#189)\r\n* serializers: with the new JSON serializer, documentation added to `?vcr_configure` and `?use_cassette` stating that you can have different cassettes with the same name as long as they use different serializers (and then have different file extensions). if you want to change serializers but do not want to keep the old cassette with the old serializer make sure to clean up the old file (#188)\r\n* now using GitHub Actions - remove Travis-CI and Appveyor (#175)\r\n* fixes for tests not being idempotent (#174) thanks @alex-gable\r\n* clean up `UnhandledHTTPRequestError` - remove unused variable `cassette` in `$initialize()` method (always use `current_cassette()` to get the cassette being used) (#163) tip from @aaronwolen\r\n* A change in latest webmockr release (`v0.7.4`) allowed for changes here to return an httr `response` object that more closely matches what httr returns in a real HTTP request. Before this the major problem was, assuming `x` is a httr `response` object, `x$request` was a `RequestSignature` object (from `webmockr`), whereas the class in a real httr response object is `request`  (#132)\r\n* Re-factor of `Cassette` class greatly simplifying webmockr HTTP request stubbing (#98) (#173) big thanks to @alex-gable !\r\n* `HTTPInteractionList` improvement: in checking for request matches against those on disk we were checking all requesets in a cassette - faster to check and stop when a match found. Using new factored out function to do this checking that stops when first match found. Many more tests added to check this behavior (#69)\r\n* base64 encoded output in cassettes when using YAML serializer are now wrapped to approximately 80 character width (triggered when `preserve_exact_body_bytes=TRUE`) - this makes cassettes longer however. Implementing this brought in use of `cpp11` (first use of C++ in vcr). This makes base64 encoded response body recording consistent with how vcr's in other programming languages do it  (#41)\r\n* `decode_compressed_response` option removed from `Cassette` class - wasn't being used and won't be used (#30)\r\n* add additional examples to `VcrResponse` docs showing what the `update_content_length_header()` does (#29)\r\n* `use_vcr()` changes: 1) now creates a test helper file called `setup-pkgname.R` instead of `helper-pkgname.R`; 2) now by default sets directory for fixtures using `dir = vcr_test_path(\"fixtures\")` instead of `dir = \"../fixtures\"`.

The user can toggle whether they get the new simplified error messages or the older format more verbose messages using the `verbose_errors` setting in the `vcr_configure()` function. In addition, `vcr_last_error()` gives the last full error, but that doesn't help in non-interactive mode; if in non-interactive mode, which most users will be in when running the entire test suite for a package, you can set an environment variable (`VCR_VERBOSE_ERRORS`) to toggle this setting (e.g.,\r\n`Sys.setenv(VCR_VERBOSE_ERRORS=TRUE); devtools::test()`) (#121) (#154)\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* changed `write_disk_path` handling internally to not run it through `normalizePath` before recording it to the cassette; passing the path through `normalizePath` was leading to the full path recorded in the cassette, which means in a package testing context that a test that uses a file on disk will (likely) only work on the machine the cassette was first created on. with relative paths in a package context, a test that has a file written on disk should now work in different testing contexts (locally, and various continuous integration platforms) (#135) (#166)\r\n* added a bit of documentation about large files created when using vcr, and how to ignore them if needed within `.Rinstignore` and/or `.Rbuildignore` (#164)", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/vcr/tarball/v0.5.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/vcr/zipball/v0.5.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/vcr/releases/tag/v0.5.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/vcr/releases/25050991", "release_id": 25050991, "date_created": "2020-03-31T15:10:11Z", "date_published": "2020-03-31T15:12:15Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/vcr/releases/24187097", "tag": "v0.5.0", "name": "vcr v0.5.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### NEW FEATURES\r\n\r\n* new function `check_cassette_names` to use in your `helper-pkgname.R` file in your test suite; it checks for duplicated cassette names only.

page](https://github.com/ropensci/vcr/issues)\n\n### Code contributions\n\n* Fork this repo to your Github account\n* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g., `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/vcr.git`\n* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `vcr` at `ropensci/vcr`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ropensci/vcr.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step\n* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch)\n* Please do write a test(s) for your changes if they affect code and not just docs\n* Push up to your account\n* Submit a pull request to home base at `ropensci/vcr`\n\n### Also, check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org)\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/vcr/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "``` r\n# Install the latest released version from CRAN\ninstall.packages(\"vcr\")\n\n# Or install the development version\n# from R-universe\ninstall.packages(\n  \"vcr\",\n  repos = c(\"https://ropensci.r-universe.dev\", \"https://cloud.r-project.org\")\n)\n\n# Or from GitHub:\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"ropensci/vcr\")\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Installation", "parent_header": ["vcr <img src=\"man/figures/logo.png\" align=\"right\" height=\"120\" alt=\"\" />"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/vcr/main/README.Rmd"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "Using vcr in a test is straightforward: just call\n`vcr::local_cassette()`. The first time your test is run, vcr will\nautomatically record every HTTP request, saving the request and reponse\nin `tests/testthat/_vcr`. After that, it will replay those recorded\nrequests, meaning that your test no longer needs an active connection.\n\n``` r\ntest_that(\"can retrieve current version\", {\n  vcr::local_cassette(\"rl_version\")\n  expect_equal(rredlist::rl_version(), \"2025-1\")\n})\n```\n\nThe first argument to `local_cassette()` is the cassette name: it\u2019s used\nto name the cassette file so needs to be unique across tests. In this\ncase, running the above test will generate\n`tests/testthat/_vcr/rl_version.yaml` which looks something like this:\n\n``` yaml\nhttp_interactions:\n- request:\n    method: GET\n    uri: https://api.iucnredlist.org/api/v4/information/red_list_version\n  response:\n    status: 200\n    headers:\n      status: 'HTTP/2 200 '\n      cache-control: max-age=0, private, must-revalidate\n      content-type: application/json\n      etag: W/\"1694e95e54c5590a355e5922b47c7cd9\"\n      date: Tue, 06 May 2025 20:52:22 GMT\n    body:\n      string: '{\"red_list_version\":\"2025-1\"}'\n  recorded_at: 2025-05-06 20:52:21\nrecorded_with: VCR-vcr/2.0.0\n```\n\nIf you look carefully at this file, you\u2019ll notice an `Authorization`\nheader is not recorded in the request headers despite it being used in\nthe actual HTTP request.
