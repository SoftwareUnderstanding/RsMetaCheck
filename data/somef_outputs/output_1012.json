We\nwould like to join the two datasets on the donor names column, but the\ntwo can\u2019t be directly joined because of misspellings. Because of this,\nwe will use the jaccard_inner_join function to fuzzily join the two on\nthe donor name column.\n\nImportantly, Locality Sensitive Hashing is a [probabilistic\nalgorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_algorithm), so it\nmay fail to identify some matches by random chance. I adjust the\nhyperparameters `n_bands` and `band_width` until the chance of true\nmatches being dropped is negligible. By default, the package will issue\na warning if the chance of a true match being discovered is less than\n95%. You can use the `jaccard_probability` and\n`jaccard_hyper_grid_search` to help understand the probability any true\nmatches will be discarded by the algorithm.\n\nMore details and a more thorough description of how to tune the\nhyperparameters can be can be found in the [guided tour\nvignette](https://beniamino.org/zoomerjoin/articles/guided_tour.html).\n\n``` r\nset.seed(1)\nstart_time <- Sys.time()\njoin_out <- jaccard_inner_join(corpus_1, corpus_2, n_gram_width = 6, n_bands = 20, band_width = 6)\n```\n\n    ## Warning in jaccard_join(a, b, mode = \"inner\", by = by, salt_by = block_by, : A pair of records at the threshold (0.7) have only a 92% chance of being compared.\n    ## Please consider changing `n_bands` and `band_width`.\n\n    ## Joining by 'field'\n\n``` r\nprint(Sys.time() - start_time)\n```\n\n    ## Time difference of 0.009142399 secs\n\n``` r\nprint(join_out)\n```\n\n    ## # A tibble: 19 \u00d7 4\n    ##        a field.x                                                      b field.y \n    ##    <dbl> <chr>                                                    <dbl> <chr>   \n    ##  1   292 bill bradley for u s senate '84                            913 bill br\u2026\n    ##  2    35 solarz for congress 82                                     671 solarz \u2026\n    ##  3   232 republican county committee of chester county              710 republi\u2026\n    ##  4    87 kentucky state democratic central executive committee      639 arizona\u2026\n    ##  5   478 united democrats for better government                     642 democra\u2026\n    ##  6   319 7th congressional district democratic party of wisconsin   792 8th con\u2026\n    ##  7   378 guarini for congress 1982                                  606 guarini\u2026\n    ##  8   378 guarini for congress 1982                                  883 guarini\u2026\n    ##  9   163 davies county republican executive committee               852 warren \u2026\n    ## 10   238 4th congressional district democratic party                792 8th con\u2026\n    ## 11    88 scheuer for congress 1980                                  667 scheuer\u2026\n    ## 12   216 kent county republican finance committee                   719 harford\u2026\n    ## 13   387 committee to re elect congressman staton                   805 committ\u2026\n    ## 14   302 americans for good government inc                          910 america\u2026\n    ## 15   216 kent county republican finance committee                   607 lake co\u2026\n    ## 16   122 tarrant county republican victory fund                     761 lake co\u2026\n    ## 17   238 4th congressional district democratic party                518 16th co\u2026\n    ## 18   230 pipefitters local union 524                                998 pipefit\u2026\n    ## 19    45 dole for senate committee                                  623 riegle \u2026\n\nZoomerjoin is able to quickly find the matching columns without\ncomparing all pairs of records.
