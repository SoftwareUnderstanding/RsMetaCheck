The noise can either be a scalar value, in which case it is assumed constant across the spectrum, or an array of the same length as the brightness_data.\n\n```python\nfrom bayes_spec import SpecData\n\nspec = SpecData(spectral_axis, brightness_data, noise, xlabel=\"Velocity\", ylabel=\"Brightness Temperature\")\n```\n\nThe spectral and brightness data are accessed via `spec.spectral` and `spec.brightness`, respectively. The noise is accessed via `spec.noise`.\n\nThe data are passed to a `bayes_spec` model in a dictionary, which allows multiple spectra to be included in a single model. For example, if a model is constrained by both an emission-line spectrum and an absorption-line spectrum, then this dictionary might look something like this:\n\n```python\nemission = SpecData(emission_spec_axis, emission_data, emission_noise, xlabel=\"Velocity\", ylabel=\"Brightness Temperature\")\nabsorption = SpecData(absorption_spec_axis, absorption_data, absorption_noise, xlabel=\"Velocity\", ylabel=\"Optical Depth\")\n\ndata = {\"emission\": emission, \"absorption\": absorption}\n```\n\nThe keys of this data dictionary (`\"emission\"` and `\"absorption\"` in this case) are important, you must remember them and use the same keys in your model definition. \n\nInternally, `SpecData` normalizes both the spectral axis and the data. Generally, this is only relevant for the polynomial baseline model, which is fit to the normalized data.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Data Format", "parent_header": ["Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tvwenger/bayes_spec/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Model specification is made though a class that extends the `bayes_spec.BaseModel` base model class definition.
