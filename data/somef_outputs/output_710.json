Issues are mainly for bug reports and package maintenance, and discussions are for usage help and brainstorming. Please respect the following guidelines.\n\n* Before posting a new issue or discussion, please take a moment to search for existing threads in order to avoid duplication.\n* For bug reports: if you can, please install the latest GitHub version of `stantargets` (i.e. `remotes::install_github(\"ropensci/stantargets\")`) and verify that the issue still persists.\n* Describe your issue in prose as clearly and concisely as possible.\n* For any problem you identify, post a [minimal reproducible example](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) like [this one](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues/256#issuecomment-754229683) so the maintainer can troubleshoot. A reproducible example is:\n    * **Runnable**: post enough R code and data so any onlooker can create the error on their own computer.\n    * **Minimal**: reduce runtime wherever possible and remove complicated details that are irrelevant to the issue at hand.\n    * **Readable**: format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).\n\n## Development\n\nExternal code contributions are extremely helpful in the right circumstances. Here are the recommended steps.\n\n1. Prior to contribution, please propose your idea in a [new issue thread](https://github.com/ropensci/stantargets/issues) so you and the maintainer can define the intent and scope of your work.\n2. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n3. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to create a new branch, add commits, and open a pull request.\n4. Discuss your code with the maintainer in the pull request thread.\n5. If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge your code into the project.\n\nPlease also follow these additional guidelines.\n\n* Respect the architecture and reasoning of the package. Depending on the scope of your work, you may want to read the design documents (package vignettes).\n* If possible, keep contributions small enough to easily review manually. It is okay to split up your work into multiple pull requests.\n* Format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and check your formatting with the `lint_package()` function from the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package.\n* Check code coverage with `covr::package_coverage()`. Automated tests should cover all the new or changed functionality in your pull request.\n* Run overall package checks with `devtools::check()` and `goodpractice::gp()`\n* Describe your contribution in the project's [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/ropensci/stantargets/blob/main/NEWS.md) file.
