If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"bnicenboim/pangoling\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of conduct\n\nPlease note that this package is released with a [Contributor\nCode of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). \nBy contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bnicenboim/eeguana/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "There is still **no** released version of *eeguana*.

The task of the experiment was to mentally count the number of\nfaces.\n\nFirst we download the data:\n\n``` r\n# Run the following or just download the files from brain_vision folder in https://osf.io/tbwvz/\nlibrary(httr)\nGET(\"https://osf.io/q6b7x//?action=download\",\n  write_disk(\"./faces.vhdr\", overwrite = TRUE),\n  progress()\n)\nGET(\"https://osf.io/ft5ge//?action=download\",\n  write_disk(\"./faces.vmrk\", overwrite = TRUE),\n  progress()\n)\nGET(\"https://osf.io/85dgj//?action=download\",\n  write_disk(\"./faces.dat\", overwrite = TRUE),\n  progress()\n)\n```\n\nBrainVision 2.0 exports three files: `faces.vhdr`, `faces.vmrk`, and\n`faces.dat`. The file `faces.vhdr` contains the metadata and links to\nthe other two files, `faces.vmrk` contains the triggers and other events\nin the samples, and `faces.dat` contains the signals at every sample for\nevery channel recorded.\n\n``` r\nlibrary(eeguana)\n```\n\nWe first need to read the data:\n\n``` r\nfaces <- read_vhdr(\"faces.vhdr\")\n#> # Reading file faces.vhdr...\n#> # Data from ./faces.dat was read.\n#> # Data from 1 segment(s) and 34 channels was loaded.\n#> # Object size in memory 140.5 Mb\n```\n\nThe function `read_vhdr()` creates a list with data frames for the\nsignal,

BrainVision, and so we\u2019ll remove\nthem from the data. We\u2019ll also segment and baseline the data. In this\nexperiment, the trigger \u201cs70\u201d was used for faces and \u201cs71\u201d for no faces.\nWe\u2019ll segment the data using these two triggers.\n\n``` r\nfaces_segs <- faces |>\n  eeg_segment(.description %in% c(\"s70\", \"s71\"),\n    .lim = c(-.2, .25)\n  ) |>\n  eeg_events_to_NA(.type == \"Bad Interval\") |>\n  eeg_baseline()\n#> # Total of 200 segments found.\n#> # Object size in memory 12.2 Mb after segmentation.\n```\n\nWe can also edit the segmentation information and add more descriptive\nlabels. Once the `eeg_lst` is segmented, the segments table includes the\nrelevant columns from the events table (but without the leading dots).\n\n*eeguana* has wrappers for many `dplyr` commands for the EEG data. These\ncommands always return an entire `eeg_lst` object so that they can be\npiped using `magrittr`\u2019s pipe, `|>`.\n\n``` r\n## To only see the segments table:\nsegments_tbl(faces_segs)\n#> Key:
