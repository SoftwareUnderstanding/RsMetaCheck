The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4.

A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version.

Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6.

Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.

If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R3BRootGroup/asyeos/dev/LICENSE"}, {"result": {"value": "AsyEOS is distributed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public Licence version 3 ([LGPLv3](https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/asyeos/blob/dev/LICENSE)).\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "License", "parent_header": ["AsyEOS Software <a href=\"COPYRIGHT\"><img alt=\"license\" src=\"https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg\" /></a> <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14291386\"><img alt=\"DOI\" src=\"https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.14291386.svg\" /></a>"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/asyeos/blob/dev/README.md"}], "description": [{"result": {"value": "Software for the AsyEOS/R3B experiments at GSI/FAIR", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"value": "Software for the AsyEOS/R3B experiments at GSI/FAIR", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/R3BRootGroup/asyeos/dev/codemeta.json"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "The AsyEOS (Asymmetric-matter Equation-Of-State) directory within the [R3BRoot](https://github.com/R3BRootGroup/R3BRoot) framework provides the full detector definitions, Monte Carlo simulation tools, and digitization algorithms for the detectors used in the AsyEOS/R3B (Reactions with Relativistic Radioactive Beams) experimental campaign at the GSI/FAIR (Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research) facility.
