The EMODnetBiocheck R package is developed in the framework of the LifeWatch and EMODnet Biology projects, and managed by the <a href=\"http://www.eurobis.org/\" target=\"_blank\">EurOBIS</a> (European Ocean Biodiversity Information System) Data Management Team at the Flanders Marine Institute (<a href=\"https://www.vliz.be/\" target=\"_blank\">VLIZ</a>). It helps users to Quality Control their (marine) biological datasets by performing a varied number of quality checks on both published and unpublished datasets. This R package also allows a thorough visual exploration of the dataset, while highlighting potential issues within the dataset. The R package can be used on: i) public IPT resources; ii) loaded data tables. The only requirement to use the R package is the existence of an Occurrence table in the dataset, although the analysis reaches its full potential using an IPT resource with <a href=\"https://obis.org/manual/dataformat/\" target=\"_blank\">OBIS-ENV data format</a> (Core: \"Event\"; Extensions: \"Occurrence\" and \"Extended Measurements or Facts\"). \n", "original_header": "Rationale"}, "confidence": 0.9694756102515737, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://github.com/EMODnet/EMODnetBiocheck/blob/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "| Quality check | Error message | Output location | Why this check? | \n| --- | - | --- | --------------------- |\n| Check if all eventIDs in an extension have corresponding eventIDs in the core. | This eventID has no corresponding eventID in the core | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The eventIDs from the extension tables must always refer to existing eventIDs, therefore, these eventIDs must be present in the core table. | \n| Checks that all eMoF eventIDs are linked to the same eventID as the related occurrenceID | This eventID differs from the eventID provided in the related Occurrence | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The records in the eMoF table may have both an eventID and an occurrenceID. This occurrenceID must exist in the occurrence table, where it will be linked to an eventID. This eventID must be the same eventID that is referred to in the eMoF table. The reason is that one occurrenceID can only be linked to one eventID. Therefore it is not coherent that the eMoF record links to an occurrenceID and an eventID that are not related. | \n| Check if eventID and parentEventID are present, and parentEventIDs have corresponding eventIDs | Field \"x\" is missing / eventID \"x\" is duplicated / parentEventID \"x\" has no corresponding eventID | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The parentEventID field is used to link 2 different eventIDs, that exist under the eventID field, in a hierarchy relationship. In this reationship, one of the eventIDs will be the parent event and the other one will be the child event. Therefore if the parentEventID field is populated, it must be populated with an existing eventID from the eventID field. Adding to the parentEventID field something different than an existing eventID is incoherent. | \n| Checks that occurrenceID is unique in the occurrence table | occurrenceID \"x\" is duplicated in the Occurrence table | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The occurrenceID acts as the Primary Key for the occurrence table, therefore two records with the same occurrenceID cannot exist in the occurrence table. | \n| Checks that all occurrenceIDs in the eMoF table exist in the Occurrence table | This occurrenceID has no corresponding occurrenceID in the occurrence Extension | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The occurrenceID from the extension tables must always refer to existing occurrenceIDs, therefore, these occurrenceIDs must be present in the occurrence table. | \n| Check if none of the records has occurrenceStatus = \"present\" | None of the occurrence records have occurrenceStatus = \"present\" | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Normally some of the occurrence records in a dataset would be \"presences\", having only \"absences\" in a dataset will likely be an error. | \n| Check on a number of fields (including some MoFs) for potential duplicated occurrences | Potential duplicate record | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | There shouldn't be duplicated occurrences in the Occurrence table. This check only looks at a limited number of fields (\"decimalLatitude\", \"decimalLongitude\", 'eventDate', 'eventTime', 'minimumDepthInMeters', 'maximumDepthInMeters', 'eventID', 'lifeStage', 'sex', 'samplingProtocol', 'scientificName',  'scientificNameID', 'identificationRemarks', 'identificationQualifier') to assess if two records are duplicated. It may happen that the records are not duplicates but that their difference is not reflected into any of the fields checked, this is why these are \"potential\" duplicates and not just duplicates. | \n| Check if coordinateUncertaintyInMeters contains non numeric values | Some coordinateUncertaintyInMeters values are not numeric | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The coordinateUncertaintyInMeters field is expressed as a number so its content must be numeric. | \n| Check if latitude contains non numeric values | Some decimalLatitude values are not numeric | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The decimalLatitude field is expressed as a number so its content must be numeric. | \n| Check which points are located on land. | Coordinates are located on land | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Marine datasets shouldn't contain records very far inland, unless these happen in large estuaries, are about marine birds or similar. | \n| Check if both lat and long are 0 | decimalLatitude and decimalLongitude are both 0 | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | It is theoretically possible that a sampling event happens at 0-0 coordinates, however it is very common to inadvertedly add 0-0 when the actual coordinates are missing. Therefore, 0-0 coordinates should always be double checked. | \n| Check if longitude contains non numeric values | Some decimalLongitude values are not numeric | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The decimalLongitude field is expressed as a number so its content must be numeric. | \n| Check which points have potentially invalid depths / Are there depths at the location deeper than the depths stored by GEBCO? (a margin of 150m is taken under consideration) | Minimum depth is greater than maximum depth / Depth value is greater than the value found in the bathymetry raster | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | A depth value must always be numeric and not much higher than the maximum depth at a certain location, it should also not be a negative value (above water) if the record is offshore. In addition, the minimum depth cannot be greater than the maximum depth. | \n| Is any BODC vocabulary term used as measurementTypeID deprecated? | This measurementTypeID is deprecated | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$mof_issues | It is not recommended using deprecated vocabulary terms, when possible, the updated version should be used. | \n| Check if there are duplicated measurementTypes linked to the same occurrenceID / Does the same measurement occurs more than once for the same occurrenceID? | Duplicate measurementType linked to the same occurrence | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Ideally a given occurrenceID can be linked to the same measurementType only once. E.g. It doesn't make sense to say that one same occurrenceID contains adults in one record but larvae in another record, it must be or either adults or larvae or both, but all expressed in only one record. | \n| Check if there are duplicated measurementTypeIDs linked to the same occurrenceID / Does the same measurement occurs more than once for the same occurrenceID? | Duplicate measurementTypeID linked to the same occurrence | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Ideally a given occurrenceID can be linked to the same measurementTypeID only once. E.g. It doesn't make sense to say that one same occurrenceID contains adults in one record but larvae in another record, it must be or either adults or larvae or both, but all expressed in only one record. | \n| Check if there are duplicated measurementTypes linked to the same eventID / Does the same measurement occurs more than once for the same eventID? | Duplicate measurementType linked to the same event | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Ideally a given eventID can be linked to the same measurementType only once. E.g. It doesn't make sense to say that the instrument used to collect this eventID is a corer in one record but a net in another record, it must be or either a corer or a net, but all expressed in only one record. | \n| Check if there are duplicated measurementTypeIDs linked to the same eventID / Does the same measurement occurs more than once for the same eventID? | Duplicate measurementTypeID linked to the same event | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Ideally a given eventID can be linked to the same measurementTypeID only once. E.g. It doesn't make sense to say that the instrument used to collect this eventID is a corer in one record but a net in another record, it must be or either a corer or a net, but all expressed in only one record. | \n| Check if there are duplicated records linked to the same occurrenceID and/or eventID / Checks that each emof is unique in the emof table | Duplicate eMoF record | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | Ideally each emof record should be present only once. E.g. It doesn't make sense to record multiple time the exact same measurement or fact. | \n| Is any BODC vocabulary term used as measurementUnitID deprecated? | This measurementUnitID is deprecated | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$mof_issues | It is not recommended using deprecated vocabulary terms, when possible, the updated version should be used. | \n| Check if measurementValue is NULL | MeasurementValue of Null | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The measurementValue field must always be populated in every record of the eMoF table. The record would be incoherent if it misses the measurementValue. | \n| Check if an occurrence related measurementValue is 0 while that occurrence has occurrenceStatus = \"present\" for biological quantifications | Biological quantification of 0 while occurrenceStatus is present | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | If an occurrence is labelled as present, as existing, quantifications related to it must be higher than 0. E.g. It doesn't make sense that an existing fish weights 0 grams or is 0 centimetres long. | \n| Check if an occurrence related measurementValue is 0 while that occurrence has occurrenceStatus = \"present\" | Biological value of 0 while occurrenceStatus is present | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | If an occurrence is labelled as present, as existing, most measurements related to it must be higher than 0. E.g. This is a warning because it could be an unregistered quantification, but it could also be a qualitative parameter, in which case it would not be a problem. | \n| Is any BODC vocabulary term used as measurementValueID deprecated? | This measurementValueID is deprecated | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$mof_issues | It is not recommended using deprecated vocabulary terms, when possible, the updated version should be used. | \n| Checks if the content of the datasetName field differs from the Title of the IPT resource | datasetName is slightly different from the title of the IPT resource | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The title and the name of a dataset should be the same. Therefore, the title of the IPT resource should be the same than the datasetName. | \n| Checks if datasetName contains more than one unique values | datasetName contains more than one unique values, excluding NA values | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | One dataset should contain only one name and therefore only one datasetName | \n| Check if the occurrences on land are marine species | Marine taxon located on land | IPTreport\\$dtb\\$general_issues | The records found on land should not be purely marine species.
