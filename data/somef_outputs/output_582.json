The method is based on the premise that\nanalyses of riverside urban phenomena are often done without a clear and\nconsistent spatial definition of the area of interest and that a\nmorphological delineation can provide a more objective and comparable\napproach. \nAccordingly, the method proposes a hierarchical delineation of four\nspatial units: the river valley, the river corridor, the corridor\nsegments and the river space. These units are defined based on the\ncombined morphologies of the river valley and urban form. The resulting\ndelineations can be used in any downstream analysis of riverside urban\nareas that can benefit from consistent and comparable spatial units,\nincluding land use, accessibility, and ecosystem services assessments. \nThe package includes functions to delineate the river valley, the river\ncorridor, the corridor segments, and the river space (i.e., the area\nbetween the riverbanks and the first line of buildings) as well as an\nall-in-one function that runs all desired delineations. The package also\nincludes functions to download and preprocess OpenStreetMap (OSM) and\nglobal Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, which are required as input\ndata for the delineation process.\n

how to propose a change to rcrisp.\nFor a detailed discussion on contributing to packages, please see the tidyverse [development contributing guide](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib) and [code review principles](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/).\n\n## Fixing typos\n\nYou can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. \nThis generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. \nYou can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n## Bigger changes\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s needed. \nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).\nSee our guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"CityRiverSpaces/rcrisp\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*  Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n   If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing.\n   \n*  Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*  Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n   The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n   The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n   You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Roadmap\n\nWe strive to develop `rcrisp` into a robust tool for delineation. Although the\npackage already produces reliable delineations, we do see room for improvement.\n\nWe plan to:\n\n*  Expand the use of input data from OpenStreetMap to Overture Maps and from\n   Copernicus GLO-30 Digital Elevation Models to Global Digital Terrain Models\n   from OpenTopography.\n*  Improve segmentation (1) by merging neighbouring corridor segments using\n   morphological similarity learned from segment-level morphometrics through\n   clustering and (2) by splitting large segments based on potential river\n   crossings identified in the street network.\n*  Improve the user interface of `rcrisp` and validate its output while building\n   an inventory of use cases to meet the needs of a broad research community.\n   \nWe will not:\n\n*  Develop `rcrisp` into a package for urban river space analysis, but maintain\n   its focus on providing morphologically grounded boundaries to be adopted in\n   subsequent analyses using other domain-specific tools.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the rcrisp project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
