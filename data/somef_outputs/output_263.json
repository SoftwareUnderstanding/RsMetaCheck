If you are new to python, we recommend installing it via [anaconda3](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). VESIcal can be installed with one line. Open a terminal and type the following:\n\n```\npip install VESIcal\n```\n\nCheck that the installation worked by entering the following lines into a terminal:\n\n```\npython\nimport VESIcal as v\n```\n\nIf no output is returned, VESIcal has installed properly! You will very likely, however, see a warning telling you that no module named 'thermoengine' could be found. The installation you performed via pip attempts to install all dependencies (other libraries that VESIcal requires), but thermoengine is not available via pip and so must be manually installed.\n\nDependencies that should automatically be installed for you are:\n\n   - pandas\n   - numpy\n   - matplotlib\n   - cycler\n   - abc\n   - scipy\n   - sys\n   - sympy\n   - copy\n\nIf any warnings related to these libraries appear, try installing them as you did VESIcal: with 'pip install [package]'.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Installing locally", "parent_header": ["VESIcal", "Installation and online use"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaylai/VESIcal/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Thermoengine is the ENKI implementation of MELTS (MagmaSat), which is the default solubility model implemented in VESIcal.
