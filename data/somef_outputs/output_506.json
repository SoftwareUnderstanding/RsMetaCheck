This will enable users to consider setups consisting of different types of panels (performance characteristics etc.) at different orientations within their energy system, e.g., when considering the power output of a mesh grid, or a minigrid comprosing multiple individual power-generaiton stations.\r\n\r\n## Tracking panels\r\nPanels can now move! Both single- and dual-axis tracking panels are now supported in CLOVER compared with previous releases.\r\n\r\n## Shorter arguments\r\nCommand-line arguments in `v5.0` were long and cumbersome, so shorter and sweeter arguments such as `-pv` and `-b` to replace `--pv-system-size` and `--storage-system-size` (so cumbersome!) were introduced as part of #83 and #87 .\r\n\r\n## Fixing fixed fixes\r\nLots of things within an energy system change over time, but a lot don't. We introduced the ability to model fixed inverter sizes and to consider fixed system costs (as well as those which scale with the capaicty of the system).\r\n\r\n# Full changelog\r\nThe full changelog

By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to the CLOVER development team.\n\n### What should I know before I get started?\n\nCLOVER was developed at Imperial College London as a means of investigating how to support rural electrification strategies in developing countries. Under continuous development since 2015, CLOVER has been used for studies of electricity systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and South America to explore the potential to provide reliable, affordable and sustainable power to rural and displaced communities.\n\nCLOVER has the capabilities to model electricity systems of any size, from those serving individual households to large communities with diverse uses of energy and beyond, but has most commonly been used for village-scale minigrids serving hundreds of users. Its core functionality is to simulate and optimise systems supplied by any combination of solar, battery storage, diesel generation and a national grid connection to supply energy under specified performance parameters. CLOVER has been used to investigate technical case studies of specific systems, as well as broader analyses of the effects of rural electrification policies, for both academic and practitionerfocused audiences.\n\n#### What is CLOVER for?\n\nCLOVER is a software tool for simulating and optimising community-scale electricity systems, typically minigrids to support rural electrification in developing countries. CLOVER allows users to model electricity demand and supply in locations and communities at an hourly resolution, for example allowing them to investigate how a specific electricity system might perform or to find the generation and storage capacity required to meet the needs of the community at the lowest cost. CLOVER can provide an insight into the technical performance, costs, and environmental impact of a system, and allow the user to evaluate many different scenarios to decide on the best way to provide sustainable, affordable and reliable electricity to the community.\n\n#### What is CLOVER not for?\n\nFundamentally, CLOVER is an energy balance model which accounts for the generation and usage of electricity at an hourly resolution. The model is only as good as its data inputs and so the user should be aware of the many caveats that are attached to energy system modelling. CLOVER does not account for technical considerations such as power balancing in real systems, the compatibility of specific electronic components, or the many other practical considerations that would be relevant when designing the exact specifications of a system being deployed in the field. CLOVER can recommend the sizing, design and performance of a potential system, but the user should use this as a guide when using these results to inform real-life systems.\n\n## How to contribute to CLOVER\n\n### Reporting bugs\n\n**Did you find a bug?** Bugs make it into our code from time to time. If you spot a bug, report it as follows:\n\n* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/CLOVER-energy/CLOVER/issues).\n\n* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/CLOVER-energy/CLOVER/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.\n\n  * If the issue is a **bug**, use the [Bug report](https://github.com/CLOVER-energy/CLOVER/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) template,\n\n  * If the issue is a **feature** request for something new that you would like to see introduced into CLOVER, use the [Feature request](https://github.com/CLOVER-energy/CLOVER/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=feature_request.md&title=) template.\n\n### Merging patches\n\n**Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?** If you have coded a solution for a bug that you have found or for an open issue, open a pull request for it as follows:\n\n* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.\n\n* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution:\n\n  * Include the relevant issue number if applicable,\n\n  * Follow the template information presented, filling in all the fields requested which are relevant to your patch.\n\n* Ensure that you include at least one administrator reviewer for your pull request. Without an appropriate review, you will be unable to merge your pull request.\n\n#### Cosmetic patches\n\n**Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?** Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of CLOVER will generally not be accepted. Contact the developers directly, or save your cosmetic changes until you are able to merge them as part of a feature or bug issue.\n\n### Questions\n\n**Do you have questions about the source code?** Ask any question about how to use CLOVER on the [Discussions](https://github.com/CLOVER-energy/CLOVER/discussions) page.\n\n### Contributing to the documentation\n\n**Do you want to contribute to the CLOVER documentation?** CLOVER is an ever-evolving piece of software. If you want to contribute to the CLOVER documentation, get in touch with the development team. CLOVER documentation updates are usually produced for major releases.\n\n## Styleguides\n\n### Git commit messages\n\n* Git Commit Messages\n* Use the present tense (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n* Use the imperative mood (\"Move cursor to...\" not \"Moves cursor to...\")\n* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less\n* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line\n* When only changing documentation, include [ci skip] in the commit title\n* Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:\n  * \ud83c\udf89 `:tada` when adding an initial commit or solving a difficult problem\n  * \ud83c\udfa8 `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code\n  * \ud83d\udc0e `:racehorse:` when improving performance\n  * \ud83d\udcdd `:memo:` when writing docs\n  * \ud83d\udc27 `:penguin:` when fixing something on Linux\n  * \u2728 `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature\n  * \ud83d\udea7 `:construction:` when part-way through working on code\n  * \ud83c\udf4e `:apple:` when fixing something on macOS\n  * \ud83c\udfc1 `:checkered_flag:` when fixing something on Windows\n  * \u23ea `:rewind:` when backing out a commit or changes\n  * \ud83d\udc1b `:bug:` when fixing a bug\n  * \ud83d\udd25 `:fire:` when removing code or files\n  * \ud83d\udc9a `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build\n  * \ud83d\udc55 `:shirt:` when removing linter warnings\n  * \u2705 `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests\n  * \ud83d\udd12 `:lock:` when dealing with security\n  * \u2b06\ufe0f `:arrow_up:` when upgrading dependencies\n  * \u2b07\ufe0f `:arrow_down:` when downgrading dependencies\n  * \ud83d\ude80 `:rocket:` when deploying code\n\n### Python styleguide\n\nAll `Python` code must conform to [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) and [pylint](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint) coding standards and must be formatted with the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatter:\n* A `mypy.ini` file within the root of the repository sets out the requirements that must be met by any code. Use `python -m mypy src/` to ensure that your code complies with the guidelines.\n  * The `pandas` package used throughout CLOVER does not correctly lint with `mypy`. As such, it is acceptable to use the `# type: ignore` comment at the end of any pandas lines to avoid `mypy` errors, though these should be kept to a minimum.\n* A `.pylintrc` file within the root of the repository sets out the linting requirements. Use `python -m pylint src/` to ensure that your code complies with the guidelines.\n* All code must be formatted with `black`.\n\nThese tests must pass for any pull request to be successfully approved and merged. You can run these tests from the root of the repository with `./bin/test-clover.sh`.\n\n### YAML styleguide\n\nAll `.yaml` files which are modified are linted with [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint). You can use `yamllint -c .yamllint-config.yaml` to run `yamllint` over any `.yaml` files that you have modified.\n\n### Changing styleguides\n\nIf you have any changes for the styleguides, make these **very clear** within your pull request message. It is unusual to have to change the styleguides to make your code pass the required tests.\n\n## Additional notes\n\n### Issue and pull request labels\n\n| Label name | `CLOVER-energy/CLOVER` :mag_right: | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `bug` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-bug) | Confirmed bugs or reports that are very likely to be bugs. |\n| `documentation` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-documentation) | Improvements or additions to documentation. |\n| `duplicate` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-duplicate) | Issues which are duplicates of other issues, i.e. they have been reported before. |\n| `enhancement` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-enhancement) | New feature or request. |\n| `feature` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-feature) | A new feature for CLOVER, considerably more important than an enhancement. |\n| `good first issue` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-good-first-issue) | Less complex issues which would be good first issues to work on for users who want to contribute to CLOVER. |\n| `good masters issue` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-good-masters-issue) | More complex issues which would be good issues to work on as part of an MSc project. |\n| `helpwanted` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-help-wanted) | The feature or bug requires more work or attention than would be used for an ordinary issue. |\n| `invalid` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-invalid) | Issues which aren't valid (e.g. user errors). |\n| `needs-reproduction` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-needs-reproduction) | Likely bugs, but haven't been reliably reproduced. |\n| `not-urgent` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-not-urgent) | Not an urgent fix, can be sorted down the line. |\n| `question` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-question) | Questions more than bug reports or feature requests (e.g. how do I do X). You should **raise questions in the discussions page** rather than raising an issue if possible. |\n| `wontfix` | [search](search-clover-repo-label-wontfix) | The CLOVER core team has decided not to fix these issues for now, either because they're working as intended or for some other reason. |\n\nThanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:\n\nCLOVER Team\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1,
