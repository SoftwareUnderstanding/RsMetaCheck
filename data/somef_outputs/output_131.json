However the functionality of the packages goes beyond final user. One major feature has to do with reproducing the scraping process. To that extent, the original polyhedra definitions are shipped (A minimal package version named min-pkg within the package, full-db in a secondary repository accesable with switchToFullDB).\n\nAll code is documented within R files. Several functions and classes (for developers) are not included in vignettes to avoid final user confusion, but it should be possible for a developer to get insights of the code following test cases, and extend funcionality or make contributions to the project.\n\n# Reproducibility\n\nThe project was built from the ground up with reproducibility in mind. To accommodate for that, each run of the scraping functionality stores information about the run in a Ledger that can be later queried for analytical purposes. \n\n## Pull Request Process\n\n1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a \n   build.\n2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment \n   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.\n\n## Code style\n\nThe code style under use is the recommended in the [google style code (GSC)](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml). \nR6 classes has no code style in GSC. The code style defined for a R6 class-object named FooBar is FooBar .\n\n\n\n\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_build_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "format": "description"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "Rpolyhedra", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}], "version": [{"result": {"value": "0.5.6", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "0.5.6", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/codemeta.json"}], "authors": [{"result": {"value": [{"value": "Alejandro Baranek", "email": "abaranek@dc.uba.ar"}], "type": "Agent", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "Alejandro Baranek", "type": "String", "email": "abaranek@dc.uba.ar"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/codemeta.json"}, {"result": {"value": "Leonardo Belen", "type": "String", "email": "leobelen@gmail.com"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/codemeta.json"}], "identifier": [{"result": {"value": "Rpolyhedra", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/codemeta.json"}], "code_of_conduct": [{"result": {"value": "# Code of Conduct\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as\ncontributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and\nour community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body\nsize, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience,\nnationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and\norientation.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment\ninclude:\n\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or\nadvances\n* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic\n  address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n  professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable\nbehavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or\nreject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions\nthat are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or\npermanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,\nthreatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces\nwhen an individual is representing the project or its community.

The [polyhedra\ndatabase](http://dmccooey.com/polyhedra/) built by David Mccooey has an\nopen format which has been scraped to feed Rpolyhedra database\n\ndmccooey files can be found in `extdata/dmccooey.com/polyhedra/`\n\n# Troubleshooting\n\n## devtools\n\n### Ubuntu\n\n``` bash\napt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nrun end user CRAN version\n\n### macOS brew\n\n``` bash\nbrew install openssl\n```\n\nAfter, in R:\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\n```\n\n## rgl\n\n### Ubuntu\n\n``` bash\nsudo apt-get install r-cran-rgl\n```\n\nPlease note that the \u2018Rpolyhedra\u2019 project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of\nConduct](https://github.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nBy\n[contributing](https://github.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\nto this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n[![ropensci_footer](https://ropensci.org/public_images/ropensci_footer.png)](https://ropensci.org)", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "4. for each polyhedron, setup rotation, position and render"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/README.Rmd"}], "application_domain": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Semantic web"}, "confidence": 0.8767225344987002, "technique": "supervised_classification"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Rpolyhedra"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/README.Rmd"}], "repository_status": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://www.repostatus.org/#active", "description": "Active \u2013 The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed."}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/README.Rmd"}], "logo": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://www.r-pkg.org:443/pkg/Rpolyhedra"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/README.Rmd"}], "images": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/man/figures/README-5-polyhedra.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://ropensci.org/public_images/ropensci_footer.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/Rpolyhedra/master/README.Rmd"}]}
