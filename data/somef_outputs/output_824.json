Make sure your code lints.\n6. Issue that pull request!\n\n## Use a Consistent Coding Style\nWe use the [official Angular code style](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide) plus a couple of things that you have to take into account\n\n* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs \n* We use pre-commits hooks using husky that will lint your code and run all the test\n  * If you want to run this by yourself you can run npm lint and npm test respectively \n\n## Did you find a bug? Help us and the community by providing a detailed bug report\n\n**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:\n- A quick summary and/or background\n- Steps to reproduce\n- What you expected would happen\n- What actually happens\n- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)\n\n## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ai4os/ai4-dashboard/issues)\nWe use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ai4os/ai4-dashboard/issues/new); it's super simple!\n\n\n\n## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache License 2.0\nIn short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache License 2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project.
