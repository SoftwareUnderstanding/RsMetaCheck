range dynamics in response to variation in climatic and environmental conditions, and anthropogenic activities. When combined with pattern-oriented modelling methods, ecological processes and drivers of range shifts and extinctions can be identified, and plausible chains of causality revealed. The open-source multi-platform R package poems provides functionality for simulating and validating projections of species' range dynamics using stochastic, lattice-based population models. Built-in modules allow parameter uncertainty to propagate through to model simulations, with their effects on species' range dynamics evaluated using Approximate Bayesian Computation. These validation procedures identify models with the structural complexity and parameterisation needed to simulate the effects of past changes in climate, environment and human activities on species' range shifts and extinction risk. We illustrate the features and versatility of poems by simulating the historical decline and extinction of the Thylacine Thylacinus cynocephalus, an icon of recent extinctions in Australia. We show that poems can reveal likely ecological pathways to extinction using pattern-oriented methods, providing validated projections of the range collapse and population decline of threatened species. By providing flexible and extendable modules for building and validating SEPMs of species' range dynamics, poems allows the effects of past and future threats on species' populations to be quantified using well-parameterised, structurally realistic models, with important generative mechanisms. Since poems can directly unravel ecological processes of species responses to global change, and strengthen predictions of range shifts and extinction risk\u2014within a flexible, R-based environment\u2014we anticipate that poems will be of significant value to ecologists, conservation managers and biogeographers.\",\n  year = \"2021\"\n)\n", "type": "File_dump", "format": "bibtex", "datePublished": "2041"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GlobalEcologyLab/poems/main/inst/CITATION"}, {"result": {"value": "You may cite poems in publications using our software paper in *Methods\nin Ecology and Evolution*:\n\nFordham, D.

If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"GlobalEcologyLab/poems\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n    If your PR addresses an issue no one has reported yet, please create an issue to reference.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the poems project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).
