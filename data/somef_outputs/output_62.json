There is no longer a separate `gc()` call on the main process.\r\n* Shave off overhead from `store_sync_file_meta()` in the general case.\r\n\r\n## Other changes\r\n\r\n* Upload workspaces to the cloud if `tar_option_get(\"repository_meta\")` is `\"aws\"` or `\"gcp\"`.

This initial `tar_make()` is slow, but subsequent `tar_make()` calls should be much faster than before the upgrade.\r\n\r\n## Other/specific changes\r\n\r\n* Speed up `tar_make()` and `tar_outdated()` by avoiding excessive buffering and disk writes for metadata and reporters when the pipeline is just skipping targets.\r\n* Use a more lookup-efficient data structure for `tar_runtime$file_info` (#1398).\r\n* Fall back on vector aggregation without names (#1401, @guglicap).\r\n* Speed up representation of file sizes in metadata (#1408).\r\n* Add a new `\"forecast_interactive\"` reporter to `tar_outdated()` to choose `\"forecast\"` for interactive sessions and `\"silent\"` for non-interactive ones.\r\n* Add a new `seconds_reporter_outdated` argument to `tar_config_set()` with a default of 1 to control the time interval of the reporter of `tar_outdated()` and other passive algorithm functions.\r\n* Remove target descriptions from the default labels of graph visualizations.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/1.10.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/1.10.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/1.10.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/194436829", "release_id": 194436829, "date_created": "2025-01-13T13:17:13Z", "date_published": "2025-01-13T14:14:56Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/188912454", "tag": "1.9.1", "name": "igraph compatibility", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 1.9.1\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Allow branch references to contain multi-element `path` vectors with cloud metadata (#1382, @n8layman).\r\n* Avoid partial matches in internal code (#1384, @olivroy).\r\n* Add error handling around calls to `ps::ps_disk_partitions()` and `ps::ps_fs_mount_point()`.\r\n* Do not store `_targets/objects/` paths in metadata for CAS repositories (#1391).\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Ensure compatibility with `igraph` >= 2.1.2.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/1.9.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/1.9.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/1.9.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/188912454", "release_id": 188912454, "date_created": "2024-12-04T11:17:55Z", "date_published": "2024-12-04T11:26:52Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/185854807", "tag": "1.9.0", "name": "Memory efficiency", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 1.9.0\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n* Un-break workflows that use `format = \"file_fast\"` (#1339, @koefoeden).\r\n* Fix deadlock in `error = \"trim\"` (#1340, @koefoeden).\r\n* Remove tailored debugging message (#1341, @koefoeden).\r\n* Store warnings while writing to storage (#1345, @Aariq).\r\n* Allow `garbage_collection` to be a non-negative integer to control the frequency of garbage collection in a performant, convenient, unified way (#1351).\r\n* Deprecate the `garbage_collection` argument of `tar_make()`, `tar_make_future()`, and `tar_make_clusterm()` (#1351).\r\n* Instrument `target_run()`, `target_prepare()`, and `target_conclude()` using `autometric`.\r\n* Avoid sending problematic error classes such as `\"vctrs_error_subscript_oob\"` to `rlang::abort()` (#1354, @Jiefei-Wang).\r\n* Reduce memory consumption by ~23% in large pipelines by avoiding the accumulation of promise objects (#1352).\r\n* Avoid `store_assert_format()` and `store_convert_object()` is `storage` is `\"none\"`.\r\n* Add a `list()` method to `tar_repository_cas()` to make it easier and more efficient to specify custom CAS repositories (#1366).\r\n* Improve speed and reduce memory consumption by avoiding deep copies of inner environments of target definition objects (#1368).\r\n* Reduce memory consumption by storing buds and branches as lightweight references when `memory` is `\"transient\"` (#1364).\r\n* Replace the `memory` class with the new `lookup` class.\r\n* Implement `memory = \"auto\"` to select transient memory for dynamic branches and persistent memory for other targets (#1371).\r\n* Omit whole pattern targets from branch subpipelines when possible.

Your pipeline code should still work, but any targets you ran before will most likely need to rerun after the upgrade.\r\n\r\n* Use SHA512 during the creation of target-specific pseudo-random number generator seeds (#1139). This change decreases the risk of overlapping/correlated random number generator streams. See the \"RNG overlap\" section of the `tar_seed_create()` help file for details and justification. Unfortunately, this change will invalidate all currently built targets because the seeds will be different. To avoid rerunning your whole pipeline, set `cue = tar_cue(seed = FALSE)` in `tar_target()`.\r\n* For cloud storage: instead of the hash of the local file, use the ETag for AWS S3 targets and the MD5 hash for GCP GCS targets (#1172). Sanitize with `targets:::digest_chr64()` in both cases before storing the result in the metadata.\r\n* For a cloud target to be truly up to date, the hash in the metadata now needs to match the *current* object in the bucket, not the version recorded in the metadata (#1172). In other words, `targets` now tries to ensure that the up-to-date data objects in the cloud are in their newest versions. So if you roll back the metadata to an older version, you will still be able to access historical data versions with e.g. `tar_read()`, but the pipeline will no longer be up to date.\r\n\r\n## Other changes to seeds\r\n\r\n* Add a new exported function `tar_seed_create()` which creates target-specific pseudo-random number generator seeds.\r\n* Add an \"RNG overlap\" section in the `tar_seed_create()` help file to justify and defend how `targets` and `tarchetypes` approach pseudo-random numbers.\r\n* Add function `tar_seed_set()` which sets a seed and sets all the RNG algorithms to their defaults in the R installation of the user. Each target now uses `tar_seed_set()` function to set its seed before running its R command (#1139).\r\n* Deprecate `tar_seed()` in favor of the new `tar_seed_get()` function.\r\n\r\n## Other cloud storage improvements\r\n\r\n* For all cloud targets, check hashes in batched LIST requests instead of individual HEAD requests (#1172). Dramatically speeds up the process of checking if cloud targets are up to date.\r\n* For AWS S3 targets, `tar_delete()`, `tar_destroy()`, and `tar_prune()` now use efficient batched calls to `delete_objects()` instead of costly individual calls to `delete_object()` (#1171).\r\n* Add a new `verbose` argument to `tar_delete()`, `tar_destroy()`, and `tar_prune()`.\r\n* Add a new `batch_size` argument to `tar_delete()`, `tar_destroy()`, and `tar_prune()`.\r\n* Add new arguments `page_size` and `verbose` to `tar_resources_aws()` (#1172).\r\n* Add a new `tar_unversion()` function to remove version IDs from the metadata of cloud targets. This makes it easier to interact with just the current version of each target, as opposed to the version ID recorded in the local metadata.\r\n\r\n## Other improvements\r\n\r\n* Migrate to the changes in `clustermq` 0.9.0 (@mschubert).\r\n* In progress statuses, change \"started\" to \"dispatched\" and change \"built\" to \"completed\" (#1192).\r\n* Deprecate `tar_started()` in favor of `tar_dispatched()` (#1192).\r\n* Deprecate `tar_built()` in favor of `tar_completed()` (#1192).\r\n* Console messages from reporters say \"dispatched\" and \"completed\" instead of \"started\" and \"built\" (#1192).\r\n* The `crew` scheduling algorithm no longer waits on saturated controllers, and targets that are ready are greedily dispatched to `crew` even if all workers are busy (#1182, #1192). To appropriately set expectations for users, reporters print \"dispatched (pending)\" instead of \"dispatched\" if the task load is backlogged at the moment.\r\n* In the `crew` scheduling algorithm, waiting for tasks is now a truly event-driven process and consumes 5-10x less CPU resources (#1183). Only the auto-scaling of workers uses polling (with an inexpensive default polling interval of 0.5 seconds, configurable through `seconds_interval` in the controller).\r\n* Simplify stored target tracebacks.\r\n* Print the traceback on error.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/1.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/1.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/1.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/133441778", "release_id": 133441778, "date_created": "2023-12-06T22:19:22Z", "date_published": "2023-12-11T16:25:47Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/124682912", "tag": "1.3.2", "name": "CRAN patch", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 1.3.2\r\n\r\n* Try to fix function help files for CRAN.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/1.3.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/1.3.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/1.3.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/124682912", "release_id": 124682912, "date_created": "2023-10-11T19:50:37Z", "date_published": "2023-10-11T19:53:42Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/124674188", "tag": "1.3.1", "name": "Cloud metadata fixes", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 1.3.1\r\n\r\n* Add `tar_config_projects()` and `tar_config_yaml()` (#1153, @psychelzh).\r\n* Apply error modes to `builder_wait_correct_hash()` in `target_conclude.tar_builder()` (#1154, @gadenbuie).\r\n* Remove duplicated error message from `builder_error_null()`.\r\n* Allow `tar_meta_upload()` and `tar_meta_download()` to avoid errors if one or more metadata files do not exist.

The only exception to this is local file targets such as `tarchetypes` literate programming target factories like `tar_render()` and `tar_quarto()`.\r\n* In the `hash_deps()` method of the metadata class, use a new custom `sort_chr()` function which temporarily sets the `LC_COLLATE` locale to `\"C\"` for sorting. This ensures lexicographic comparisons  are consistent across platforms (#1108).\r\n* In `tar_source()`, use the `file` argument and `keep.source = TRUE` to help with interactive debugging (#1120).\r\n* Deprecated `seconds_interval` in `tar_config_get()`, `tar_make()`, `tar_make_clustermq()` and `tar_make_future()`. Replace it with `seconds_meta` (to control how often metadata gets saved) and `seconds_reporter` (to control how often to print messages to the R console) (#1119).\r\n* Respect `seconds_meta` and `seconds_reporter` for writing metadata and console messages even for currently building targets (#1055).\r\n* Retry all cloud REST API calls with HTTP error codes (429, 500-599) with the exponential backoff algorithm from `googleAuthR` (#1112).\r\n* For `format = \"url\"`, only retry on the HTTP error codes above.\r\n* Make cloud temp file instances unique in order to avoid file conflicts with the same target.\r\n* Un-deprecate `seconds_interval` and `seconds_timeout` from `tar_resources_url()`, and implement `max_tries` arguments in `tar_resources_aws()` and `tar_resources_gcp()`

`tar_prune()` and `tar_delete()`, do not try to delete pattern targets which have no cloud storage.\r\n* Add new arguments `seconds_timeout`, `close_connection`, `s3_force_path_style` to

Both are configurable via `tar_resources_url()` (#1048).\r\n* Use `parallelly::freePort()` in `tar_random_port()`.\r\n* Rename a target and a function in the `tar_script()` example pipeline (#1033, @b-rodrigues).\r\n* Edit the description.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/1.0.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/1.0.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/1.0.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/100682925", "release_id": 100682925, "date_created": "2023-04-24T15:53:31Z", "date_published": "2023-04-24T15:54:52Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/94922059", "tag": "0.14.3", "name": "CRAN patch", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 0.14.3\r\n\r\n* Handle encoding errors while trying to process error and warning messages (#1019, @adrian-quintario).\r\n* Fix S3 generic/method consistency.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/0.14.3", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/0.14.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/0.14.3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/94922059", "release_id": 94922059, "date_created": "2023-03-08T11:57:49Z", "date_published": "2023-03-08T12:33:04Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/87958919", "tag": "0.14.2", "name": "Error handling tweaks", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 0.14.2\r\n\r\n* Forward user-level custom error conditions to the top of the pipeline (#997, @alexverse).\r\n* Link to the help page of the manual.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/0.14.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/0.14.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/0.14.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/87958919", "release_id": 87958919, "date_created": "2023-01-05T02:14:54Z", "date_published": "2023-01-05T02:16:29Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/84462593", "tag": "0.14.1", "name": "Bug fixes", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 0.14.1\r\n\r\n* Fix the command inserted for debug mode (#975).\r\n* Set empty chunk options to ensure Target Markdown compatibility with the special \"setup\" chunk (#973, @KaiAragaki).\r\n* Only store the first 50 warnings in the metadata, and cap the text of the warning messages at 2048 characters (#983, @thejokenott).\r\n* Enhance the `tar_destroy()` help file (#988, @Sage0614).\r\n* Implement `destroy = \"user\"` in `tar_destroy()`.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/0.14.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/0.14.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/0.14.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/84462593", "release_id": 84462593, "date_created": "2022-11-29T14:40:13Z", "date_published": "2022-11-29T15:02:00Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/81688973", "tag": "0.14.0", "name": "Extend RNG seed functionality", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 0.14.0\r\n\r\n* Move `#!/bin/sh` line to the top of SLURM `clustermq` template file (#944, #955, @GiuseppeTT).\r\n* Add new function `tar_path_script()`.\r\n* Rename `tar_store()` to `tar_path_store()` with deprecation.\r\n* Rename `tar_path()` to `tar_path_target()` with deprecation.\r\n* Add new function `tar_path_script_support()`.\r\n* Make Target Markdown target scripts dynamically locate their support scripts so the appropriate scripts can be found even when they are generated from one directory and sourced from another (#953, #957, @TylerGrantSmith).\r\n* Allow user-side control of the seeds at the pipeline level. `tar_option_set()` now supports a `seed` argument, and target-specific seeds are determined by `tar_option_get(\"seed\")` and the target name. `tar_option_set(seed = NA)` disables seed-setting behavior but forcibly invalidates all the affected targets except when `seed` is `FALSE` in the target's `tar_cue()` (#882, @sworland-thyme, @joelnitta).\r\n* Implement a `seed` argument in `tar_cue()` to control whether targets update in response to changing or `NA` seeds (#882, @sworland-thyme, @joelnitta).\r\n* Reduce the number of per-target AWS/GCP storage API calls.

Different buckets can now have different regions. This feature required modifying the metadata path for AWS storage formats. Before, the first element of the path was simply the bucket name. Now, it is internally formatted like `\"bucket=BUCKET:region=REGION\"`, where `BUCKET` is the user-supplied bucket name and `REGION` is the user-supplied region name. The new `targets` is back-compatible with the old metadata format, but if you run the pipeline with `targets` >= 0.8.1.9000 and then downgrade to `targets` <= 0.8.1, any AWS targets will break.\r\n* Add new reporters `timestamp_positives\"` and `\"verbose_positives\"` that omit messages for skipped targets (@psanker, #683).\r\n* Implement `tar_assert_file()`.\r\n* Implement `tar_reprex()` for creating easier reproducible examples of pipelines.\r\n* Implement `tar_store()` to get the path to the store of the currently running pipeline (#714, @MilesMcBain).\r\n* Automatically write a `_targets/user/` folder to encourage `gittargets` users to put custom files there for data version control.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Make sure `tar_path()` uses the current store path of the currently running pipeline instead of `tar_config_get(\"store\")` (#714, @MilesMcBain).\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Refactor the automatic `.gitignore` file inside the data store to allow the metadata to be committed to version control more easily (#685, #711).\r\n* Document target name requirements in `tar_target()` and `tar_target_raw()` (@tjmahr, #679).\r\n* Catch and relay any the error if a target cannot be checked in `target_should_run.tar_builder()`.

The old single-project format is gracefully deprecated (#622, @yyzeng, @atusy, @nsheff, @wdkrnls).\r\n* Implement `retrieval = \"none\"` and `storage = \"none\"` to anticipate loading/saving targets from other languages, e.g. Julia (@MilesMcBain).\r\n* Add a new `tar_definition()` function to get the target definition object of the current target while that target is running in a pipeline.\r\n* If called inside an AWS target, `tar_path()` now returns the path to the staging file instead of `_targets/objects/target_name`. This ensures you can still write to `tar_path()` in `storage = \"none\"` targets and the package will automatically hash the right file and upload it to the cloud.

Helps control workspace behavior independently of the `error` argument of `tar_target()` (#405, #533, #534, @mattwarkentin, @xinstein).\r\n* Implement `error = \"abridge\"` in `tar_target()` and related functions.

The help file explains each environment variable in detail.\r\n* Support extra project-level configuration settings with `_targets.yaml` (#297). New functions `tar_config_get()` and `tar_config_set()` interact with the `_targets.yaml` file. Currently only supports the `store` field to set the data store path to something other than `_targets/`.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n* Shut down superfluous persistent workers earlier in dynamic branching and when all remaining targets have `deployment = \"main\"` (#398, #399, #404, @pat-s).\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Attempt to print only the useful part of the traceback in `tar_traceback()` (#383).\r\n* Add a line break at the end of the \"summary\" reporter so warnings do not mangle the output.\r\n* In `tar_watch()`, use `shinybusy` instead of `shinycssloaders` and keep current output on display while new output is rendering (#386, @rcorty).\r\n* Right-align the headers and counts in the \"summary\" and \"forecast\" reporters.\r\n* Add a timestamp to the \"summary\" reporter.\r\n* Make the reporters show when a target ends (#391, @mattwarkentin).\r\n* Make the reporters show when a pattern ends if the pattern built at least one target and none of the targets errored or canceled.\r\n* Use words \"start\" and \"built\" in reporters.\r\n* Use the region of the AWS S3 bucket instead of the local `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable (`check_region = TRUE`; #400, @tomsing1).\r\n* In `tar_meta()`, return `POSIXct` times in the time zone of the calling system (#131).\r\n* Throw informative error messages when a target's name or command is missing (#413, @liutiming).\r\n* Bring back ALTREP in `qs::qread()` now that `qs` 0.24.1 requires `stringfish` >= 1.5.0 (#147, @glep).\r\n* Relax dynamic branching checks so `pattern = slice(...)` can take multiple indexes (#406, #419, @djbirke, @alexgphayes)\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/0.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/0.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/0.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/41849221", "release_id": 41849221, "date_created": "2021-04-22T15:10:50Z", "date_published": "2021-04-22T15:13:30Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/40582058", "tag": "0.3.1", "name": "CRAN hotfix: arrow formats", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 0.3.1\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* `queue$enqueue()` is now `queue$prepend()` and always appends to the front of the queue (#371).\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Throw a warning if `devtools::load_all()` or similar is detected inside `_targets.R` (#374).\r\n\r\n## CRAN\r\n\r\n* Skip `feather` and `parquet` tests on CRAN.", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/tarball/0.3.1", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/zipball/0.3.1", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/releases/tag/0.3.1", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/40582058", "release_id": 40582058, "date_created": "2021-03-27T16:50:28Z", "date_published": "2021-03-27T16:53:53Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/targets/releases/40470372", "tag": "0.3.0", "name": "Arrow formats, HPC performance, infrastructure refactor, GHA", "author": {"name": "wlandau", "type": "User"}, "description": "# targets 0.3.0\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* Fix the \"write target at cursor\" RStudio addin and move cursor between the parentheses.\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* Add a `backoff` option in `tar_option_set()` to set the maximum upper bound (seconds) for the polling interval (#333).\r\n* Add a new `tar_github_actions()` function to write a GitHub Actions workflow file for continuous deployment of data analysis pipelines (#339, @jaredlander).\r\n* Add a new `TAR_MAKE_REPORTER` environment variable to globally set the reporter of the `tar_make*()` functions (#345, @alexpghayes).\r\n* Support new storage formats \"feather\", \"parquet\", \"aws_feather\", and \"aws_parquet\" (#355, @riazarbi).\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n* Implement an exponential backoff algorithm for polling the priority queue in `tar_make_clustermq()` and `tar_make_future()` (#333). \r\n* In `tar_make_future()`, try to submit a target every time a worker is polled.\r\n* In `tar_make_future()`, poll workers in order of target priority.\r\n* Avoid the time delay in exiting on error (from https://github.com/r-lib/callr/issues/185).\r\n* Clone target objects for the pipeline and scrape more `targets` internal objects out of the environment in order to avoid accidental massive data transfers to workers.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements\r\n\r\n* Use `rlang::check_installed()` inside `assert_package()` (#331, @malcolmbarrett).\r\n* Allow `tar_destroy(destroy = \"process\")`.\r\n* In `tar_watch()`, increase default `seconds` to 15 (previously 5).\r\n* In `tar_watch()`, debounce instead of throttle inputs.\r\n* In `tar_watch()`, add an action button to refresh the outputs.\r\n* Always deduplicate metadata after `tar_make()`.

If you are asking for help about a specific issue, please first read <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/help.html>.\n\n## Issues\n\n<https://github.com/ropensci/targets/issues> is for maintenance tasks feature requests. When you post, please abide by the same guidelines as <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/help.html>.\n\n## Development\n\nExternal code contributions are extremely helpful in the right circumstances. Here are the recommended steps.\n\n1. Prior to contribution, please propose your idea in a discussion thread so you and the maintainer can define the intent and scope of your work.\n2. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n3. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) to create a new branch, add commits, and open a pull request.\n4. Discuss your code with the maintainer in the pull request thread.\n5. If everything looks good, the maintainer will merge your code into the project.\n\nPlease also follow these additional guidelines.\n\n* Respect the architecture and reasoning of the package. Depending on the scope of your work, you may want to read the design documents (package vignettes).\n* If possible, keep contributions small enough to easily review manually. It is okay to split up your work into multiple pull requests.\n* Format your code according to the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) and check your formatting with the `lint_package()` function from the [`lintr`](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr) package.\n* For new features or functionality, add tests in `tests`. Tests that can be automated should go in `tests/testthat/`. Tests that cannot be automated should go in `tests/interactive/`. For features affecting performance, it is good practice to add profiling studies to `tests/performance/`.\n* Check code coverage with `covr::package_coverage()`. Automated tests should cover all the new or changed functionality in your pull request.\n* Run overall package checks with `devtools::check()` and `goodpractice::gp()`\n* Describe your contribution in the project's [`NEWS.md`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/NEWS.md) file. Be sure to mention relevent GitHub issue numbers and your GitHub name as done in existing news entries.\n* If you feel contribution is substantial enough for official author or contributor status, please add yourself to the `Authors@R` field of the [`DESCRIPTION`](https://github.com/ropensci/targets/blob/main/DESCRIPTION) file.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/CONTRIBUTING.md"}], "has_build_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "format": "description"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "DESCRIPTION", "type": "Url", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "targets", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}], "version": [{"result": {"value": "1.11.4.9003", "type": "String", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/DESCRIPTION"}, {"result": {"value": "1.11.1", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/codemeta.json"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": ["https://github.com/ropensci/targets/actions?query=workflow%3Acheck", "https://app.codecov.io/gh/ropensci/targets", "https://github.com/ropensci/targets/actions?query=workflow%3Alint"], "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/codemeta.json"}], "development_status": [{"result": {"value": "https://www.repostatus.org/#active", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/codemeta.json"}], "identifier": [{"result": {"value": "targets", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/codemeta.json"}], "authors": [{"result": {"value": "['William', 'Michael'] Landau", "type": "String", "email": "will.landau.oss@gmail.com", "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1878-3253"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/targets/main/codemeta.json"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "citHeader(\"To cite targets in publications use:\")\n\nbibentry(\n  bibtype = \"Article\",\n  title = \"The targets R package: a dynamic Make-like function-oriented pipeline toolkit for reproducibility and high-performance computing\",\n  author = \"William Michael Landau\",\n  journal = \"Journal of Open Source Software\",\n  year = 2021,\n  volume = 6,\n  number = 57,\n  pages = 2959,\n  url = \"https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.02959\",\n  textVersion = paste(\n    \"Landau, W.
