If necessary, the encoding can be changed from UTF-8 via the new argument.\r\n    * It appears that the EPUB format *requires* UTF encoding.

The first thing\nthat stands out is the naming convention using `item` followed by some\nordered digits does not differentiate sections like the book preamble\nfrom the chapters. The numbering also starts in a weird place. But it is\nactually worse than this. Notice that sections are not broken into\nchapters; they can begin and end in the middle of chapters!\n\nThese annoyances aside, the metadata and contents can still be read into\na convenient table. Text mining analyses can still be performed on the\noverall book, if not so easily on individual chapters.
