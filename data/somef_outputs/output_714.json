The function returns a `CompadreDB` object by default, but can also be set to produce lists of MPMs or life tables.\r\n- `generate_mpm_set()` is now deprecated, and will be removed at a later date. Users should use `rand_lefko_set()` instead. \r\n- `random_mpm()` is now deprecated, and will be removed at a later date. Users should use `rand_lefko_mpm()` instead.\r\n- The new set generation functions omit the arguments `split`, `by_type` and `as_compadre`, which governed output types in `generate_mpm_set()`. These arguments been replaced with a simpler and more transparent argument, `output`.\r\n- Added new function `compute_ci_U()` which calculates confidence intervals for traits derived from matrix models where only the U submatrix is used. For example, life expectancy (using the function `Rage::life_expect_mean()`). \r\n- Added a vignette for generating Leslie matrices.\r\n- Added a vignette for generating Lefkovitch matrices.\r\n\r\n\r\n# mpmsim 2.0.0\r\n\r\n- removed dependency on `MCMCpack`, which is reportedly being archived from CRAN.

Now the values are provided as mean fecundity and can be provided as a range of values, whereby a value is drawn from a random uniform distribution. This is the best way to create a set of models with different fecundity properties.\r\n- added function to simulate the action of drivers such as weather on vital rates: `drive_vital_rate()`.\r\n- added `model_mortality()` as an alias for `model_survival()`.\r\n- function `generate_mpm_set()` now returns a `CompadreDB` object by default.\r\n- added full suite of unit tests using `testthat`.

The specific parameters for mortality and\nreproduction are provided as defined distributions from which parameters\ncan be drawn at random. The type of distribution is defined with the\n`dist_type` argument and can be `uniform` or `normal`, and the\ndistributions are defined using the `mortality_params` and\n`fecundity_params` arguments, which accept data frames of distribution\nparameters.\n\nFor example, the following code produces a list of five Leslie matrices\nthat have Gompertz-Makeham mortality characteristics and where\nreproduction is a step function.\n\nFirst, we define the limits of a uniform distributions for the Gompertz\nmortality and step fecundity functions.\n\n``` r\nmortParams <- data.frame(\n  minVal = c(0.05, 0.08, 0.7),\n  maxVal = c(0.14, 0.15, 0.7)\n)\n\nfecParams <- data.frame(minVal = 4, maxVal = 6)\n```\n\nWe also set maturity to be drawn from a distribution ranging from 0 to\n3.\n\n``` r\nmaturityParams <- c(0, 3)\n```\n\nNow we produce the models. We output as \u201c`Type5`\u201d which is a simple list\nof the main A matrix model, but outputs can also be split into\nsubmatrices (e.g.\u00a0the U and F matrices), or as a `CompadreDB` object.\n\n``` r\noutputMPMs <- rand_leslie_set(\n  n_models = 5, mortality_model = \"GompertzMakeham\", fecundity_model = \"step\",\n  mortality_params = mortParams,\n  fecundity_params = fecParams,\n  fecundity_maturity_params = maturityParams,\n  dist_type = \"uniform\",\n  output = \"Type5\"\n)\n\noutputMPMs\n#> [[1]]\n#>           [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]      [,6]\n#> [1,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 4.5722791 4.5722791 4.5722791\n#> [2,] 0.4305453 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [3,] 0.0000000 0.4210229 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [4,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4102704 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [5,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.3981747 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [6,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.3846275 0.3695309\n#> \n#> [[2]]\n#>           [,1]      [,2]     [,3]      [,4]      [,5]      [,6]\n#> [1,] 0.0000000 5.4731766 5.473177 5.4731766 5.4731766 5.4731766\n#> [2,] 0.4429031 0.0000000 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [3,] 0.0000000 0.4366956 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [4,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.429826 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [5,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000 0.4222377 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [6,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.000000 0.0000000 0.4138729 0.4046735\n#> \n#> [[3]]\n#>           [,1]     [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]      [,6]\n#> [1,] 0.0000000 0.000000 0.0000000 4.9154836 4.9154836 4.9154836\n#> [2,] 0.4419032 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [3,] 0.0000000 0.434841 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [4,] 0.0000000 0.000000 0.4269406 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [5,] 0.0000000 0.000000 0.0000000 0.4181238 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [6,] 0.0000000 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4083108 0.3974225\n#> \n#> [[4]]\n#>          [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]      [,6]\n#> [1,] 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 4.9245856 4.9245856 4.9245856\n#> [2,] 0.431272 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [3,] 0.000000 0.4250633 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [4,] 0.000000 0.0000000 0.4183198 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [5,] 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4110069 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [6,] 0.000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4030901 0.3945359\n#> \n#> [[5]]\n#>           [,1]      [,2]      [,3]      [,4]      [,5]      [,6]\n#> [1,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 4.9499942 4.9499942 4.9499942 4.9499942\n#> [2,] 0.4298125 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [3,] 0.0000000 0.4241257 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [4,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4180004 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [5,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4114112 0.0000000 0.0000000\n#> [6,] 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.0000000 0.4043329 0.3967408\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Sets of Leslie matrices", "parent_header": ["mpmsim <img src=\"man/figures/logo_mpmsim.png\" alt=\"mpmsim package logo, featuring a stylized matrix population model diagram\" align=\"right\" height=\"100\" style=\"float:right; height:100px;\">", "Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonesor/mpmsim/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"value": "The `rand_lefko_set` function can be used to quickly generate large\nnumbers of Lefkovitch MPMs using the above approach.
