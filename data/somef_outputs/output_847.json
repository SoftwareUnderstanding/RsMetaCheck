{"value": "# Contributing\n\nboinor is a community project, all contributions are more than welcome!\n\n## What you can do\n\n### Report bugs\n\nNot only things can break, but also different people have\ndifferent use cases for the project. If you find anything that doesn't\nwork as expected or have suggestions, please open a new issue on our\n[issue tracker](https://github.com/boinor/boinor/issues).\n\n### Participate in the chat\n\nMost of the project discussions happen in [the project chat](http://chat.boinor.space/),\nwhere announcements are first made, newcomers ask questions,\nand in general project users exchange all sorts of information.\n[Join today!](http://chat.boinor.space/)\n\n### Improve the Documentation\n\nDocumentation can always be expanded and improved.\nThe docs are stored in text files under the `docs/source` directory,\nand the Python classes and methods also feature inline docs\nin the form of docstrings.\n\n### Contribute your research scripts\n\nWe would love to give your Astrodynamics scripts a home!\nPlease head to [our `contrib/` directory](https://github.com/boinor/boinor/tree/main/contrib)\nfor further information.\n\n### Fix bugs and add new features\n\nCode contributions are welcome! If you are looking for a place to start,\ncheck out the [\"good-first-issue\" label](https://github.com/boinor/boinor/labels/good%20first%20issue)\non our issue tracker. Those tasks should be easier to fix than the others\nand require less knowledge about the library.\n\n## How to contribute\n\n### Work from GitHub\n\nGitHub makes it very easy to make small contributions\ndirectly from your browser, without having to install any additional software.\nTo get familiar with the process, you can do\n[this interactive GitHub training](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github).\nOnce you have finished it, you can edit the boinor source files\nstraight from GitHub and open pull requests from your browser.\n\n### Work locally\n\nFor more complex contributions, it will be more effective\nto set up a local development environment and work from your own computer.\n\nThe most important thing is to understand how Git works. Git is a decentralized\nversion control system that preserves the history of the software, helps\ntracking changes and allows for multiple versions of the code to exist\nat the same time. To learn more, you can have a look at\n[this Getting Started guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git).\n\nFinally, you might want to have an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)\nthat makes editing the source files easier.\nIf you are hesitant on what IDE or editor to use,\nhave a look at [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/),\n[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),\nor [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/).\n\n### Work from a cloud environment\n\nThere are some cloud options that give you\nthe flexibility of a powerful IDE with a terminal,\nall from your web browser so you don't have to install anything.\nTwo popular cloud environments for development are\n[the GitHub web editor](https://github.dev/boinor/boinor)\nand [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/boinor/boinor/).\n\n## Command line instructions\n\nIn the sections below you can read step-by-step guides to\nperform common development tasks on the command line.\nAll these instructions are meant for UNIX-like operating systems,\nfor example:\n\n- Linux (any distribution will work)\n- macOS\n- Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)\n\n### Set up a development environment\n\nTo set up a development environment you will need Git and Python\nup and running. You should only need to do this once!\n\nStart by setting up Git:\n\n1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/) on your computer.\n2. [Sign up to GitHub](https://github.com/).\n3. [Fork boinor](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n4. [Clone your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)\n   (remote name will be `origin`)\n5. Add an `upstream` remote with `git remote add upstream https://github.com/boinor/boinor.git`\n   and fetch its information with `git fetch upstream`\n6. Set your `main` branch to track `upstream` using `git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main`\n\nNext, configure your Python environment:\n\n6. Install Python for development.\n7. Create a Python virtual environment using `python -m venv .venv`\n8. Activate it using `source .venv/bin/activate`\n9. Upgrade the development dependencies using `python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel flit tox`\n10. Install the code in development mode using `python -m pip install -e .`\n    (this means that the installed code will change as soon as you change it in the\n    download location).\n\nAnd with this, you will be ready to start contributing!\n\n### Pull request workflow\n\nEvery time you want to contribute some code or documentation to boinor,\nyou will need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Make sure that your `main` branch is up to date: `git switch main`\n   (or `git checkout main`) and `git pull --rebase upstream main`\n2. Create a new branch using `git switch --create descriptive-name-of-my-change`.\n3. Make your changes!\n4. Commit your changes using `git commit -m 'Add new awesome feature'`.\n5. [Push to your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/).\n6. [Open a pull request!](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n\nOne branch corresponds to one pull request. This means that,\nif you keep committing and pushing changes to the same branch,\nthe pull request will update automatically (you don't need to open a new one!).\n\nWhen your pull request is merged, you can:\n\n7. Update your `main` branch again: `git switch main` and `git pull --rebase upstream main`\n8. Delete your local branch: `git branch --delete descriptive-name-of-my-change`\n9. Refresh your fork: `git fetch --prune origin` and `git push origin main`\n\nRemember that, whenever you want to start a new pull request,\nyou need to start from step 1.\n\n### Build the documentation\n\nTo build the docs, you will need some system dependencies.\nOn Debian-like systems (Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc),\nthey can be installed running:\n\n```console\n$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install \\\npandoc texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-fonts-recommended dvipng graphviz cm-super-minimal\n```\n\nThen, either run:\n\n```console\n$ tox -e docs\n```\n\nor, alternatively:\n\n```console\n(.venv) $ pip install -e .[doc]  # Installs doc dependencies\n(.venv) $ cd docs\n(.venv) $ make html\n```\n\nAfter this, the new docs will be inside `build/html`. You can open them\nby running an HTTP server:\n\n```console\n$ cd build/html\n$ python -m http.server\nServing HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...\n```\n\nAnd point your browser to <http://0.0.0.0:8000>.\n\n### Make code changes\n\nYou want to contribute new features or fix existing behavior? You are awesome!\nBefore rushing out though, make sure if the new feature you propose\nis within the scope of the library (best thing is to ask in\n[the chat](http://chat.boinor.space/))\nor that the fix you want to apply has a corresponding issue in the issue tracker.\n\nApart from all the steps described above, you need to have these extra things in mind:\n\n1. Add tests to your code. You have lots of examples in the `tests/` directory\n   to get inspiration from. All new features and fixes should be tested,\n   and in the ideal case the coverage rate should increase or stay the same.\n2. To check if your code is correct, run `tox`. This command runs the code\n   style, the tests and build the documentation of the project.\n3. Notice that you can run a subset of the tests by\n   passing extra arguments to pytest, for example running\n   `tox -e tests-fast -- -k \"anomaly\"`\n\nAutomatic services will ensure your code works\non all the supported operating systems and Python versions.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":

It is through these differences that our community\nexperiences success and continued growth. We expect everyone in our\ncommunity to follow these guidelines when interacting with others both\ninside and outside of our community. Our goal is to keep ours a\npositive, inclusive, successful, and growing community.\n\nAs members of the community,\n\n- We pledge to treat all people with respect and provide a harassment-\n  and bullying-free environment, regardless of sex, sexual orientation\n  and/or gender identity, disability, physical appearance, body size,\n  race, nationality, ethnicity, and religion. In particular, sexual\n  language and imagery, sexist, racist, or otherwise exclusionary\n  jokes are not appropriate.\n- We pledge to respect the work of others by recognizing\n  acknowledgment/citation requests of original authors. As authors, we\n  pledge to be explicit about how we want our own work to be cited or\n  acknowledged.\n- We pledge to welcome those interested in joining the community, and\n  realize that including people with a variety of opinions and\n  backgrounds will only serve to enrich our community. In particular,\n  discussions relating to pros/cons of various technologies,\n  programming languages, and so on are welcome, but these should be\n  done with respect, taking proactive measure to ensure that all\n  participants are heard and feel confident that they can freely\n  express their opinions.\n- We pledge to welcome questions and answer them respectfully, paying\n  particular attention to those new to the community. We pledge to\n  provide respectful criticisms and feedback in forums, especially in\n  discussion threads resulting from code contributions.\n- We pledge to be conscientious of the perceptions of the wider\n  community and to respond to criticism respectfully. We will strive\n  to model behaviors that encourage productive debate and\n  disagreement, both within our community and where we are criticized.\n  We will treat those outside our community with the same respect as\n  people within our community.\n- We pledge to help the entire community follow the code of conduct,\n  and to not remain silent when we see violations of the code of\n  conduct. We will take action when members of our community violate\n  this code such as contacting <juanlu001+boinor-coc@gmail.com>\n  (all emails sent to this address will be treated with the strictest\n  confidence) or talking privately with the person.\n\nThis code of conduct applies to all community situations online and\noffline, including mailing lists, forums, social media, conferences,\nmeetings, associated social events, and one-to-one interactions.\n\nParts of this code of conduct have been adapted from the Astropy code of\nconduct.\n\nThe Code of Conduct for the boinor community is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.
