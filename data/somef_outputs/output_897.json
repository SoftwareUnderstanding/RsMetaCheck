This is a bit faster than passing `SpatRaster` objects to `truth` and\r\n  `estimate`, as extraction is only done once per grid rather than twice, but \r\n  does not easily support passing R functions to `aggregation_function`.\r\n  \r\n* Metric functions now have better error messages including the name of the \r\n  function the _user_ called that errored, not the internal function that \r\n  errored. Huge thanks to @EmilHvitfeldt for their PR (#40).\r\n\r\n* Data frame metric functions now guarantee that `.estimate` will be an unnamed\r\n  vector.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* The `sf` method for `ww_multi_scale()` is now _much_ faster (and more memory \r\n  efficient). \r\n  \r\n* Fixed the warning when `ww_area_of_applicability()` calculates an AOA \r\n  threshold of 0.

Note that `ww_willmott_dr()` uses the version\r\n  from Willmott (2012); other implementations (sometimes called \"d1r\") seem to \r\n  use an unbounded variant that I haven't found a reference to support.\r\n\r\n* Changed a call in `ww_area_of_applicability()` to use FNN for nearest \r\n  neighbors, rather than fields. This sped up prediction by a _lot_.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n* Rewrote README and moved the old content to a new vignette on assessing the\r\n  spatial dependency in model residuals.\r\n  \r\n* Added a dependency on FNN.\r\n\r\n* Minimum version for dplyr has been bumped to 1.1.0\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/tarball/v0.3.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/zipball/v0.3.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/waywiser/releases/tag/v0.3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/releases/96128064", "release_id": 96128064, "date_created": "2023-03-19T22:26:32Z", "date_published": "2023-03-20T00:03:35Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/releases/80719474", "tag": "v0.2.0", "name": "waywiser 0.2.0", "author": {"name": "mikemahoney218", "type": "User"}, "description": "* Added functions for calculating the area of applicability of a model. \r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/tarball/v0.2.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/zipball/v0.2.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/waywiser/releases/tag/v0.2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/releases/80719474", "release_id": 80719474, "date_created": "2022-10-23T00:38:24Z", "date_published": "2022-10-23T04:18:39Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/releases/74113376", "tag": "v0.1.0", "name": "waywiser 0.1.0", "author": {"name": "mikemahoney218", "type": "User"}, "description": "* Added functions for automatically constructing `nb` and `listw` objects\r\n\r\n* Added functions for global and local Geary's C values.\r\n\r\n* Added functions for local Getis-Ord G and G* values.\r\n\r\n* Added functions for global and local Moran's I values.\r\n\r\n* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/tarball/v0.1.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/zipball/v0.1.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/waywiser/releases/tag/v0.1.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/waywiser/releases/74113376", "release_id": 74113376, "date_created": "2022-08-05T20:11:43Z", "date_published": "2022-08-10T14:59:39Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "# --------------------------------------------\n# CITATION file created with {cffr} R package\n# See also: https://docs.ropensci.org/cffr/\n# --------------------------------------------\n \ncff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: 'To cite package \"waywiser\" in publications use:'\ntype: software\nlicense: MIT\ntitle: 'waywiser: Ergonomic Methods for Assessing Spatial Models'\nversion: 0.6.2.9000\ndoi: 10.48550/arXiv.2303.11312\nidentifiers:\n- type: doi\n  value: 10.32614/CRAN.package.waywiser\nabstract: Assessing predictive models of spatial data can be challenging, both because\n  these models are typically built for extrapolating outside the original region represented\n  by training data and due to potential spatially structured errors, with \"hot spots\"\n  of higher than expected error clustered geographically due to spatial structure\n  in the underlying data. Methods are provided for assessing models fit to spatial\n  data, including approaches for measuring the spatial structure of model errors,\n  assessing model predictions at multiple spatial scales, and evaluating where predictions\n  can be made safely.

tidyverse packages, please see the\n[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib). \n\nThis package is in an initially stable state of development, with a great deal of active subsequent development envisioned.\n\n## Fixing typos\n\nYou can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. \nThis generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. \nYou can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.\n\n## Bigger changes\n\nIf you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s needed. \nIf you\u2019ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"mikemahoney218/waywiser\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the waywiser project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/).

A tibble: 85 \u00d7 3\n#>    .metric       .estimator .estimate\n#>    <chr>         <chr>          <dbl>\n#>  1 local_moran_i standard      0.548 \n#>  2 local_moran_i standard      0.943 \n#>  3 local_moran_i standard      0.636 \n#>  4 local_moran_i standard      0.700 \n#>  5 local_moran_i standard      0.137 \n#>  6 local_moran_i standard      0.917 \n#>  7 local_moran_i standard      0.900 \n#>  8 local_moran_i standard      1.79  \n#>  9 local_moran_i standard      0.0208\n#> 10 local_moran_i standard      0.750 \n#> #
