Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
