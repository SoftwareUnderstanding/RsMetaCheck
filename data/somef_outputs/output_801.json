It is especially dedicated to omics data obtained using a typical dose-response design, favoring a great number of tested doses (or concentrations) rather than a great number of replicates (no need of replicates to use `DRomics`). \nAfter a first step which consists in importing, checking and if needed normalizing/transforming the data (step 1), the aim of the proposed workflow is to select monotonic and/or biphasic significantly responsive items (e.g. probes, contigs, metabolites) (step 2), to choose the best-fit model among a predefined family of monotonic and biphasic models to describe the response of each selected item (step 3), and to derive a benchmark dose or concentration from each fitted curve (step 4). Those steps can be performed in R using `DRomics` functions, or using the shiny application named `DRomics-shiny`. \nIn the available version, `DRomics` supports single-channel microarray data (in log2 scale), RNAseq data (in raw counts) and other continuous omics data such as metabolomics or proteomics (in log scale). In order to link responses across biological levels based on a common method, `DRomics` also handles continuous apical data as long as they meet the use conditions of least squares regression (homoscedastic Gaussian regression). \nAs built in the environmental risk assessment context where omics data are more often collected on non-sequenced species or species communities, `DRomics` does not provide an annotation pipeline. The annotation of items selected by `DRomics` may be complex in this context, and must be done outside `DRomics` using databases such as KEGG or Gene Ontology. `DRomics` functions can then be used to help the interpretation of the workflow results in view of the biological annotation. It enables a multi-omics approach, with the comparison of the responses at the different levels of organization (in view of a common biological annotation). It can also be used to compare the responses at one organization level, but measured under different experimental conditions (e.g. different time points). This interpretation can be performed in R using `DRomics` functions, or using a second shiny application `DRomicsInterpreter-shiny`. \n", "original_header": "DRomics: Dose Response for Omics <img src=\"man/figures/hexsticker.png\" align=\"right\" style=\"float:right; height:120px;\"/>"}, "confidence": 0.9404188310033742, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://github.com/lbbe-software/DRomics/blob/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "A **vignette** is attached to the `DRomics` package.\nThis vignette is intended to help users to start using the `DRomics` package.
