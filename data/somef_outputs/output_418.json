First, while other packages exist for calculating\ndistances on directed graphs, notably [`igraph`](https://igraph.org/r/),\neven that otherwise fabulous package does not (readily) permit analysis\nof *dual-weighted* graphs. Dual-weighted graphs have two sets of weights\nfor each edge, so routing can be evaluated with one set of weights,\nwhile distances can be calculated with the other. A canonical example is\na street network, where *weighted distances* are assigned depending on\nmode of transport (for example, weighted distances for pedestrians on\nmulti-lane vehicular roads are longer than equivalent distances along\nisolated walking paths), yet the desired output remains direct,\nunweighted distances. Accurate calculation of distances on street\nnetworks requires a dual-weighted representation. In **R**, `dodgr` is\ncurrently the only package that offers this functionality (without\nexcessive data wrangling). \nThird, `dodgr` goes beyond the functionality of comparable packages\nthrough including routines to aggregate flows throughout a network,\nthrough specifying origins, destinations, and flow densities between\neach pair of points. Alternatively, flows can be aggregated according to\na network dispersal model from a set of origin points and associated\ndensities, and a user-specified dispersal model. \nFourth and finally, `dodgr` implements highly realistic and\nfully-customisable profiles for routing through street networks with\nvarious modes of transport, and using either distance- or time-based\nrouting. Routing can include such factors as waiting times at traffic\nlights, delays for turning across oncoming traffic, access restrictions,\nand the effects of elevation on both cyclists and pedestrians.

If you haven't done this before,\nthere's a nice overview of git [here](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html), as well\nas best practices for submitting pull requests\n[here](https://r-pkgs.org/git.html#pr-make).\n\nThe `dodgr` coding style diverges somewhat from [this commonly used R style\nguide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), primarily in the following two ways,\nboth of which improve code readability: (1) All curly braces are vertically aligned:\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n{\n    x <- 1\n}\n```\nand **not**\n```r\nthis <- function(){\n    x <- 1\n}\n```\nand (2) Also highlighted in that code is the additional whitespace which\npermeates `dodgr` code. Words of text are separated by whitespace, and so\ncode words should be too:\n```r\nthis <- function1 (function2 (x))\n```\nand **not**\n```r\nthis <- function1(function2(x))\n```\nwith the natural result that one ends up writing\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n```\nwith a space between `function` and `()`. That's it.\n\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe want to encourage a warm, welcoming, and safe environment for contributing to\nthis project.

Random vertices may be generated in this case through\nselecting `id` values:\n\n``` r\nfrom <- sample (v$id, size = 20)\nto <- sample (v$id, size = 50)\nd <- dodgr_dists (graph = graph, from = from, to = to)\ndim (d)\n#> [1] 20 50\n```\n\nAlternatively, the points may be specified as matrices of geographic\ncoordinates:\n\n``` r\nfrom_x <- min (graph$from_lon) + runif (20) * diff (range (graph$from_lon))\nfrom_y <- min (graph$from_lat) + runif (20) * diff (range (graph$from_lat))\nto_x <- min (graph$from_lon) + runif (50) * diff (range (graph$from_lon))\nto_y <- min (graph$from_lat) + runif (50) * diff (range (graph$from_lat))\nd <- dodgr_dists (graph = graph, from = cbind (from_x, from_y), to = cbind (to_x, to_y))\n```\n\nIn this case, the random points will be mapped on to the nearest points\non the street network. This may, of course, map some points onto minor,\ndisconnected components of the graph. This can be controlled either by\nreducing the graph to it\u2019s largest connected component only:\n\n``` r\ngraph <- graph [graph$component == 1, ]\nnrow (graph)\n```\n\nor by explicitly using the `match_points_to_verts()` function with the\noption `connected = TRUE`:\n\n``` r\nfrom <- match_points_to_verts (v, cbind (from_x, from_y), connected = TRUE)\nto <- match_points_to_verts (v, cbind (to_x, to_y), connected = TRUE)\n```\n\nThis function returns an index into the result of `dodgr_vertices`, and\nso points to use for routing must then be extracted as follows:\n\n``` r\nfrom <- v$id [from] # or from <- v [from, c (\"x\", \"y\")]\nto <- v$id [to]\nd <- dodgr_dists (graph = graph, from = from, to = to)\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Usage: Distances and Times", "parent_header": ["dodgr: Distances on Directed Graphs in R"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UrbanAnalyst/dodgr/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"value": "Flow aggregation refers to the procedure of routing along multiple ways\naccording to specified densities of flow between defined origin and\ndestination points, and aggregating flows along each edge of the\nnetwork.
