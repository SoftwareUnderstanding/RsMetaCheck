"The `pid-component` is an easily extensible web component that can be used to display PIDs, ORCiDs, and other\nidentifiers in a user-friendly way.\nIt is easily extensible to support other identifier types. \nThe `pid-component` dynamically renders a component based on the value of the `value` property.\nDepending on the value, it decides which component to render, what priority to give it, and what props to pass to it.\nIt also renders itself recursively for all its children when unfolded.\nYou can set the maximum depth of recursion with the `level-of-subcomponents` property.\nBy default, it is set to 1, which means that it will only render the first level of children, but not their children.\nYou can prohibit unfolding of the component by setting the `current-level-of-subcomponents` to the same value as\nthe `level-of-subcomponents` property. \nYou can try this web component in the [demo](https://kit-data-manager.github.io/pid-component). \n**Please notice that you must use the hyphenated version of an attribute when using the component directly in HTML (\ne.g. `currentLevelOfSubcomponents` -> `current-level-of-subcomponents`).\nWhen using inside Stencil or with JSX/TSX syntax, you must use the camelCase version.**\n \n", "original_header": "PID Component"}, "confidence": 0.9237430617585303, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source":
