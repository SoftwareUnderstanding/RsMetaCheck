However, due to the time limitation of telescope operation, only 3.5 hours of data were collected under V band filter at Trottier Observatory. 219 raw data frames were collected, with each exposed for 60 seconds and binned to 2048 by 2048 pixels. \nThe data first went through the process of calibration with master Bias, master dark current and master flat frames. This process reduces the effect of dark current in CCD during data collection and lowers the overall noise. The calibrated science frames then went through the sky subtraction procedure using SEP, a Python library for source extraction and photometry. The sky subtraction procedure removed artificial and urban lights reflected from atmosphere. Once the sky background is subtracted, then in theory, all light sources in the science frames are due to astronomical source only. \nwhere _m_ is the instrumental magnitude, _F_ is the total flux of object in the frame, _t_<sub>exp</sub> is the exposure time (i.e. 60 seconds) and _\u03c3_ are the corresponding errors. \nIn order to obtain the apparent magnitude of RR Leo in each frame, the apparent magnitude of a standard reference star in the same frame has to be known. In this project, GSC 1968:912 is used as the reference star. It has an apparent magnitude of 11.02 in V band. GSC 1968:912 was extracted from the same frame and its instrumental magnitude was calculated using the equations above. Then, the apparent magnitude of RR Leo was calculated by subtracting the magnitude offset of GSC 1968:912 from RR Leo\u2019s instrumental magnitude. \nIn addition, the atmospheric extinction has effects on the brightness and wavelength of the observed objects. By applying a linear fit on the magnitude of the brightest object in all the frames and the air mass (i.e. the thickness of the atmosphere in units of the thickness towards the zenith) at which the frame was captured, \nwhere _m_<sub>\u03bb</sub> is the measured magnitude, _m_<sub>\u03bb0</sub> is the magnitude as seen above the atmosphere, _X_ is the air mass and the atmospheric extinction coefficient, _k_<sub>\u03bb</sub>, is measured and labelled on the resulting graph.\n \n", "original_header": "Methodology"}, "confidence": 0.9133970510791872, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hykelvinlee42/RRLeo-Photometry/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "The apparent magnitude of RR Leo and its error in each frame were plotted in the figure, with respect to the time in the data collection period.
