Also use `--enable-aac` to enable building the bridge with AAC rewriting tactics (requires `rocq-aac-tactics`).\nThen compile using `make` and install using `make install`.\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "INSTALLATION", "parent_header": ["Relation Algebra for Rocq"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien-pous/relation-algebra/master/README.md"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "Each module is documented, see index.html or \n     http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/damien.pous/ra\nfor:\n- a description of each module's role and dependencies\n- a list of the available user-end tactics\n- the coqdoc generated documentation.\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "DOCUMENTATION", "parent_header": ["Relation Algebra for Rocq"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien-pous/relation-algebra/master/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Relation Algebra for Rocq"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damien-pous/relation-algebra/master/README.md"}]}
