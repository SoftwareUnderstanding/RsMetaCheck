Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!\n\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation. If not, [report an issue][new_issue] and we can point you in the right direction.\n\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).\n\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for our_package? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.\n\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1.

Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6.
