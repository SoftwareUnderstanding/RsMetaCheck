First, users are\nable to download data from the National Map via the `get_tiles`\nfunction, downloading data tiles for the area represented by an `sf` or\n`Raster` object:\n``` r\nlibrary(terrainr)\nlibrary(sf)\n\nlocation_of_interest <- tmaptools::geocode_OSM(\"Hyampom California\")$coords\n\nlocation_of_interest <- data.frame(\n  x = location_of_interest[[\"x\"]],\n  y = location_of_interest[[\"y\"]]\n)\n\nlocation_of_interest <- st_as_sf(\n  location_of_interest, \n  coords = c(\"x\", \"y\"), \n  crs = 4326\n)\n\nlocation_of_interest <- set_bbox_side_length(location_of_interest, 8000)\n\noutput_tiles <- get_tiles(location_of_interest,\n                          services = c(\"elevation\", \"ortho\"),\n                          resolution = 30 # pixel side length in meters\n                          )\n```\nOnce downloaded, these images are in standard GeoTIFF or PNG formats and\ncan be used as expected with other utilities:\n``` r\nraster::plot(raster::raster(output_tiles[[\"elevation\"]][[1]]))\n```\n \nFinally, terrainr helps you visualize this data, both natively in R via\nthe new `geom_spatial_rgb` geom:\n``` r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot() + \n  geom_spatial_rgb(data = output_tiles[[\"ortho\"]],\n                   aes(x = x, y = y, r = red, g = green, b = blue)) + \n  coord_sf(crs = 4326) + \n  theme_void()\n```\n \nAs well as with the Unity 3D rendering engine, allowing you to fly or\nwalk through your downloaded data sets in 3D and VR:\n``` r\nwith_progress( # When not specifying resolution, default is 1m pixels\n  output_tiles <- get_tiles(location_of_interest,\n                            services = c(\"elevation\", \"ortho\"))\n)\n\nmerged_dem <- merge_rasters(output_tiles[[\"elevation\"]], \n                            tempfile(fileext = \".tif\"))\nmerged_ortho <- merge_rasters(output_tiles[[\"ortho\"]], \n                              tempfile(fileext = \".tif\"))\n\nmake_manifest(output_tiles$elevation,\n              output_tiles$ortho)\n```\n \nThe more time intensive processing steps can all be monitored via the\n[progressr](https://github.com/futureverse/progressr) package, so you\u2019ll\nbe more confident that your computer is still churning along and not\njust stalled out.

For the \"georeference \r\n      a single image\" use case, see the new `georeference_overlay` function.\r\n    * `get_tiles` gains an argument `resolution` (details below) between \r\n      `side_length` and `services`. No functionality should be changed, but code \r\n      with unnamed arguments to `services`, `verbose`, or `georeference` may be \r\n      impacted. \r\n* New features:\r\n    * A new family of functions for dealing with overlay creation:\r\n        * `vector_to_overlay` lets users quickly produce image overlays from \r\n          vector data.\r\n        * `georeference_overlay` replaces the use of merge_raster for creating \r\n          single-file georeferenced overlay files.\r\n        * `combine_overlays` lets users, well, combine overlays into a single \r\n          image\r\n    * `get_tiles` gains an argument, `resolution`, specifying the number of \r\n      meters each pixel should represent (so higher images result in smaller \r\n      downloads). \r\n    * `get_bbox` provides an S3 generic to create `terrainr_bounding_box` \r\n      objects. In this version, that means users can use `get_bbox` to get \r\n      bounding boxes from `sf` and `RasterLayer` objects, and it means adding \r\n      methods will be easier going forward. The generic `get_bbox` method \r\n      is equivalent to `get_coord_bbox`\r\n    * `raster_to_raw_tiles` handles rectangles appropriately\r\n* Improvements and bug fixes:\r\n    * `get_tiles`, `raster_to_raw_tiles`, and `merge_rasters` are now much more \r\n      conscientious about deleting tempfiles when they're done with them.\r\n    * `merge_rasters` no longer fails when handed a mix of 3- and 4-band raster\r\n      files. The current implementation will cast all 4 band rasters to 3 band\r\n      images and then return a 3 band raster image.\r\n    * The `output_image` argument to `merge_rasters` now has a default value of \r\n      `tempfile(fileext = \".tif\")` to be a little more friendly to users.\r\n    * Arguments `lat` and `lng` to `get_bbox` (and `get_coord_bbox`) no longer \r\n      need to be quoted -- either the tidyverse-feeling NSE approach or the \r\n      more standard quoted argument approach will work.\r\n* Internal changes:\r\n    * All terrainr-provided functions now explicitly use the terrainr:: \r\n      namespace.\r\n* Changes in dependencies:\r\n    * `sf` has been added as an explicit import due to `vector_to_overlay`. `sf`\r\n      is required by `gdalUtilities`, also imported by this package, so this \r\n      change should have no impact on users.\r\n    * `rlang` is added as a dependency to allow `lat` and `lng` be unquoted in \r\n      `get_bbox`.\r\n    * `ggplot2` has been added to `Suggests` due to `vector_to_overlay`. \r\n    * `jpeg` and `tiff` have been added to `Suggests` due to \r\n      `georeference_overlay`. I'd expect more image libraries to join this list\r\n      over time.

`.R` file below `R/`.\n*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and\nmake sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s a problem. If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  \n*  Look at the GitHub build status before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  We recommend the tidyverse [style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2).  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the terrainr project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
