Choose the one that best fits your needs. We first present the recommended methods using package managers, then the manual installation from source code.\n\n## Recommended installation methods\n### Using conda\n\nAt each release of samurai, conda packages are built and made available on the `conda-forge` channel. To install samurai using conda, simply run:\n\n```bash\nconda install samurai\n```\n\nFor compiling purposes, you have to install a C++ compiler, `cmake`, and (optionaly) `make`:\n\n```bash\nconda install cxx-compiler cmake [make]\n```\n\nIf you have to use PETSc to assemble the matrix of your problem, you need to install it:\n\n```bash\nconda install petsc pkg-config\n```\n\nFor parallel computation,\n\n```bash\nconda install libboost-mpi libboost-devel libboost-headers 'hdf5=*=mpi*'\n```\n\n### Using spack\n\nsamurai is also available through the spack package manager. To install samurai using spack, simply run:\n\n```bash\nspack install samurai\n```\n\nFor mpi support, you can add the `+mpi` variant:\n\n```bash\nspack install samurai +mpi\n```\n\nFor petsc support, you can add the `+petsc` variant:\n\n```bash\nspack install samurai +petsc\n```\n\n## Manual installation from source code\n\nFirst, clone the samurai repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/hpc-maths/samurai\ncd samurai\n```\n\nThen, you have to install the following dependencies:\n- A C++20 compiler\n- CMake\n- xtensor\n- CLI11\n- fmt\n- HighFive\n- pugixml\n- PETSc (optional, only if you want to use it)\n- MPI (optional, only if you want to use samurai in parallel)\n- libboost-mpi (optional, only if you want to use samurai in parallel)\n- hdf5 with MPI support (optional, only if you want to use samurai in parallel)\n\nIf you already have a conda installation (or mamba) on your system, you can use the provided environment files to create an environment with all the dependencies installed (see the `conda` directory).\n\n### Install the dependencies using conda/mamba\n\nTo install the dependencies using conda or mamba, you can create an environment using the provided environment files in the `conda` directory.\n\n```bash\nconda env create --file conda/environment.yml\n```\n\nfor sequential computation, or\n\n```bash\nconda env create --file conda/mpi-environment.yml\n```\n\nfor parallel computation. Then\n\n```bash\nconda activate samurai-env\n```\n\n### Install samurai with CMake\n\n- Configure the build with CMake\n\n```bash\ncmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/installation/directory\n```\n\n- Install samurai\n\n```bash\ncmake --build ./build --target install\n```\n\n```{note}\nSince samurai is a header-only library, the installation step simply copies the header files to the specified installation directory.\n```\n\n### Build the samurai demos with CMake\n\nIf you want to be sure that samurai dependencies are correctly installed, you can build and run the provided demos in samurai.\n\n- Configure the build with CMake\n\n```bash\ncmake . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_DEMOS=ON\n```\n\n- Build the demos\n\n```bash\ncmake --build ./build --target all\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpc-maths/samurai/master/docs/source/howto/installation.md"}, {"result": {"value": "```bash\nmamba install samurai\n```\n\nFor compiling purposes, you have to install a C++ compiler, `cmake`, and (optionaly) `make`:\n\n```bash\nmamba install cxx-compiler cmake [make]\n```\n\nIf you have to use PETSc to assemble the matrix of your problem, you need to install it:\n\n```bash\nmamba install petsc pkg-config\n```\n\nFor parallel computation,\n\n```bash\nmamba install libboost-mpi libboost-devel libboost-headers 'hdf5=*=mpi*'\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "From conda", "parent_header": ["Installation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpc-maths/samurai/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "If you want to install samurai from Conan, you can use the following command:\n\n```bash\nconan install --requires=samurai/0.13.0\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "From Conan Center", "parent_header": ["Installation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpc-maths/samurai/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "Run the cmake configuration\n\n- With mamba or conda\n\n    First, you need to create the environment with all the dependencies\n    installed, run\n\n    ```bash\n    mamba env create --file conda/environment.yml\n    ```\n\n    for sequential computation, or\n\n    ```bash\n    mamba env create --file conda/mpi-environment.yml\n    ```\n\n    for parallel computation.
