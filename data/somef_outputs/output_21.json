The package originates from a set of scripts to compute climate indices in our previous studies. Building up on the interest in expanding the analysis to other regions and to enable reproducible and replicable studies we developed `climatrends`. Most of the package functions take into account the heterogeneity of testing sites (locations), dates and seasons, a common characteristic of decentralized agricultural trials. Further development was made to enable time series analysis with fixed periods of time and locations. The package `climatrends` computes temperature, precipitation, crop growing and crop stress indices that were validated by previous studies on climatology and crop science.
