No reinventing the wheel: it relies on the JAX ecosystem whenever possible, such as [equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox/) for neural networks or [optax](https://optax.readthedocs.io/) for optimization. \n- **jinns is highly modular** - It gives users maximum control for defining their problems, and extending the package. The maths and computations are visible and not hidden behind layers of code! \n- **jinns is efficient** - It compares favorably to other existing Python package for PINNs on the [PINNacle benchmarks](https://github.com/i207M/PINNacle/), as demonstrated in the table below.

First fork the library on Gitlab.\n\n2. Then clone and install the library in development mode with\n\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n\n3. Install pre-commit and run it. Our pre-commit hooks consist in `ruff format` and `ruff check`. You can install `ruff` simply by `pip install ruff`. We highly recommend you to check the code type hints with `pyright` even though we currently have no rule concerning type checking in the pipeline.\n\n```bash\npip install pre-commit\npre-commit install\n```\n\n 4. Open a merge request once you are done with your changes, the review will be done via Gitlab.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contributing"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}], "contributors": [{"result": {"value": "Don't hesitate to contribute and get your name on the list here !\n\n**List of contributors:** Hugo Gangloff, Nicolas Jouvin, Lucia Clarotto, Inass Soukarieh, Mohamed Badi\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contributors"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "Please consider citing our work if you found it useful to yours, using this [ArXiV preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14132)\n```\n@article{gangloff_jouvin2024jinns,\n  title={jinns: a JAX Library for Physics-Informed Neural Networks},\n  author={Gangloff, Hugo and Jouvin, Nicolas},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.14132},\n  year={2024}\n}\n```", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Cite us"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "@article{gangloff_jouvin2024jinns,\n    year = {2024},\n    journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:2412.14132},\n    author = {Gangloff, Hugo and Jouvin, Nicolas},\n    title = {jinns: a JAX Library for Physics-Informed Neural Networks},\n}", "type": "Text_excerpt", "format": "bibtex", "title": "jinns: a JAX Library for Physics-Informed Neural Networks", "author": "Gangloff, Hugo and Jouvin, Nicolas"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "jinns"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}], "related_documentation": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://optax.readthedocs.io/", "format": "readthedocs"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}], "logo": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/img/jinns-diagram.png"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}], "related_papers": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.01008.pdf"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14132"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mia-jinns/jinns/main/README.md"}]}
