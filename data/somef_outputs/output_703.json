The following works just as well:\n\n``` r\n    d <- nassqs(commodity_desc = \"corn\", year__GE = 2012, state_alpha = \"va\")\n```\n\nYou can request data for multiple values of the same parameter by using\na simple list as follows:\n\n``` r\n    params <- list(commodity_desc = \"CORN\", year__GE = 2012, state_alpha = c(\"VA\", \"WA\"))\n    d <- nassqs(params)\n```\n\nNASS does not allow GET requests that pull more than 50,000 records in\none request. The function will inform you if you try to do that. It will\nalso inform you if you\u2019ve requested a set of parameters for which there\nare no records.\n\nOther useful functions include:\n\n``` r\n    # returns a set of unnique values for the parameter \"STATISTICCAT_DESC\"\n    nassqs_param_values(\"statisticcat_desc\")\n    \n    # returns a count of the number of records for a given query\n    nassqs_record_count(params=params)\n    \n    # Get yields specifically\n    # Equivalent to including \"'statisticat_desc' = 'YIELD'\" in your parameter list. \n    nassqs_yields(params)\n    \n    # Get acres specifically\n    # Equivalent to including all \"AREA\" values in statisticcat_desc\n    nassqs_acres(params)\n    \n    # Specifies just \"AREA HARVESTED\" values of statisticcat_desc\n    nassqs_acres(params, area = \"AREA HARVESTED\")\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Usage"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rnassqs/main/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"value": "The NASS API handles other operators by modifying the variable name.
