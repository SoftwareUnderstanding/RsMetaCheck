read.abares 1.0.0\r\n\r\n## Major changes\r\n\r\n* Rename functions that both download and read files into active R session from `get_` to `read_` to avoid confusion with functions that only fetch data and have separate `read_` functions\r\n\r\n* Adds new function, `print_agfd_nc_file_format()` to provide details on the AGFD NetCDF files' contents\r\n\r\n* Uses Geopackages for {sf} objects rather than .Rds, faster and smaller file sizes when caching\r\n\r\n* Checks and corrects the geometries of the AAGIS Regions shapefile upon import and applies to the cached object if applicable\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n* No longer checks the length of a Boolean vector when checking the number of files in the cache before proceeding with removing them\r\n\r\n* Fixes bugs in `get_agfd()` when creating the directories for saving the downloaded file\r\n\r\n* Fixes bug in `get_aagis_regions()` when creating the cached object file\r\n\r\n* Fixes \"URL\" field in DESCRIPTION file, thanks @mpadge\r\n\r\n## Minor changes\r\n\r\n* Improved documentation\r\n\r\n  * All data sets now have an `@source` field that points to the file being provided\r\n  \r\n  *  All data sets now have an `@references` field that points to references for the data\r\n\r\n* Code linting thanks to [{flint}](https://flint.etiennebacher.com)\r\n\r\n* Use {httr2} to handle downloads\r\n\r\n  * Increase timeout values to deal with stubborn long-running file downloads\r\n  * Uses {httr2}'s caching functionality to simplify in-session caching\r\n  \r\n* Use {brio} to write downloads to disk\r\n\r\n* Use {httptest2} to help test downloads\r\n\r\n* Gracefully handle errors when AGFD zip files are corrupted on download, provide the user with an informative message and remove corrupted download\r\n\r\n* Tests are run in parallel for quicker testing\r\n\r\n* {sf} operations are now quiet when reading data where possible\r\n", "tarball_url":

If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"adamhsparks/read.abares\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the read.abares project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
