For more detailed\ninfo about contributing to this, and other tidyverse packages, please see the\n[**development contributing guide**](https://rstd.io/tidy-contrib).\n\n### Fixing typos\n\nSmall typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using\nthe GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the _source_ file.\n\n*  YES: you edit a roxygen comment in a `.R` file below `R/`.\n*  NO: you edit an `.Rd` file below `man/`.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nBefore you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and\nmake sure someone from the team agrees that it\u2019s a problem. If you\u2019ve found a\nbug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug with a minimal \n[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).\n\n### Pull request process\n\n*  We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).  \n*  Look at the Travis and AppVeyor build status before and after making changes.\nThe `README` should contain badges for any continuous integration services used\nby the package.  \n*  New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org).\nYou can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to\napply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with \nyour PR.  \n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with\n[Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html), \nfor documentation.  \n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat). Contributions\nwith test cases included are easier to accept.  \n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` below the\ncurrent development version header describing the changes made followed by your\nGitHub username, and links to relevant issue(s)/PR(s).\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the tradestatistics project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
