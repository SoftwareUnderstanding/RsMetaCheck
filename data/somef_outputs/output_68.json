Contributing\n\nThank you for taking the time to contribute to this project.\nThe maintainers greatly appreciate the interest of contributors and rely on continued engagement with the community to ensure that this project remains useful.\nWe would like to take steps to put contributors in the best possible position to have their contributions accepted.\nPlease take a few moments to read this short guide on how to contribute; bear in mind that contributions regarding how to best contribute are also welcome.\n\n## Feedback and Questions\n\nIf you wish to discuss anything related to the project, please open an issue or start a topic on the [EGI Community Forum](https://community.egi.eu).\nThe maintainers will sometimes move issues off of GitHub to the community forum if it is thought that longer, more open-ended discussion would be beneficial, including a wider community scope.\n\n## Kinds of contributions\n\nThe maintainers recognise that contributions can be made in many forms, depending on the skills, experience and perspectives of interested parties.\n**The maintainers recognise the multilingual nature of the community and welcome translations of the documentation and project supporting files**.\nWe undertake to identify these contributions through consensus-building and recognise them as formal contributions to the project where applicable.\nContributions may come in the form of:\n\n  - Feature or documentation requests, where they describe a need or gap\n  - Authoring or review of releases\n  - Direct authorship of code or documentation\n  - Identifying and fixing bugs\n\n## Contribution Process\n\nBefore proposing a contribution via pull request, please ensure that an issue is open describing the need for your contribution.\nYou will need to refer to this issue number when you submit the pull request.\n  - **It is recommended to make pull requests against release candidate branches, whenever features are involved**, instead of against the master branch. See [Release Cycle](#release-cycle) below.\n  - Pull requests to the master branch can be made in the case obvious fixes. See [Obvious Fix Policy](#obvious-fix-policy)\n\nWe have a 3 step process for contributions.\n\n  1. Fork the project if you have not, and commit changes to a git branch\n  1. Create a GitHub Pull Request for your change, following the instructions in the pull request template.\n  1. Perform a [Code Review](#code-review-process) with the maintainers on the pull request.\n\n### Pull Request Requirements\n\n  1. **Explain your contribution in plain language.** To assist the maintainers in understanding and appreciating your pull request, please use the template to explain _why_ you are making this contribution, rather than just _what_ the contribution entails.\n  1. **This style guide is built to last.** We strive to ensure high quality and long-term applicability of the guide, ensuring that it stays up to date with the development of Ansible.\n  1. **Tests.** We expect tests to pass before peer review will begin.\n\n\n### Code Review Process\n\nCode review takes place in GitHub pull requests. See [this article](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) if you're not familiar with GitHub Pull Requests.\n\nOnce you open a pull request, maintainers will review your code using the built-in code review process in Github PRs. The process at this point is as follows:\n\n1. A maintainer will review your code and merge it if no changes are necessary. Your change will be merged into the repository's `master` branch and will be noted in the project's `CHANGELOG.md` at the time of release.\n1. If want your contribution to motivate your inclusion in the authorship, please add a line to that effect in the pull request\n2. If a maintainer has feedback or questions on your changes they they will set `request changes` in the review and provide an explanation.\n\n\n### Obvious Fix Policy\n\nSmall contributions, such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property can be made against the master branch\n\nAs a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. Assuming the change does not affect functionality, some common obvious fix examples include the following:\n\n- Spelling / grammar fixes\n- Typo correction, white space and formatting changes\n- Comment clean up\n- Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants\n- Adding logging messages or debugging output\n- Changes to 'metadata' files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.\n- Moving source files from one directory or package to another\n\n**Whenever you invoke the \"obvious fix\" rule, please say so in your commit message:**\n\n```\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncommit 370adb3f82d55d912b0cf9c1d1e99b132a8ed3b5\nAuthor: Julia Child <devguru@egi.eu>\nDate:   Wed Sep 18 11:44:40 2015 -0700\n\n  Fix typo in the README.\n\n  Obvious fix.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n## Using git\n\nFor collaboration purposes, it is best if you create a GitHub account and fork the repository to your own account. Once you do this you will be able to push your changes to your GitHub repository for others to see and use, and it will be easier to send pull requests.\n\n### Branches and Commits\n\nYou should submit your patch as a git branch named after the Github issue, such as `#3`\\. This is called a _topic branch_ and allows users to associate a branch of code with the ticket.\n\nIt is a best practice to have your commit message have a _summary line_ that includes the ticket number, followed by an empty line and then a brief description of the commit. This also helps other contributors understand the purpose of changes to the code.\n\n```gitlog\n    #3 - platform_family and style\n\n    * use platform_family for platform checking\n    * update notifies syntax to \"resource_type[resource_name]\" instead of\n      resources() lookup\n    * GH-692 - delete config files dropped off by packages in conf.d\n    * dropped debian 4 support because all other platforms have the same\n      values, and it is older than \"old stable\" debian release\n```\n\n## Release Cycle\n\nWe follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as far as applicable.\nThis pattern says that software versions should take an `X.Y.Z` pattern where:\n\n- X is a major release, which may not be fully compatible with prior major releases\n- Y is a minor release, which adds both new features and bug fixes\n- Z is a patch release, which adds just bug fixes\n\nReleases are generally performed after any bugfix / feature enhancement pull request merge. You can watch the Github repository for updates.\nThe latest release will always point to the master branch, whilst release candidates will be done in version-specific branches, such as `v0.2.0-rc`.\n\n### Publishing Releases\n\nMajor releases are published in Zenodo, using the GitHub integration.\nA `codemeta.json` must accompany each release accurately describing the research object, and properly recognising author and contributor metadata.\n\n## Contribution Do's and Don't's\n\n1. Please do include tests for your contribution.\n1. If you need help, ask on the [EGI Operations community](https://community.egi.eu/c/operations)\n1. Please do indicate new platform (families) or platform versions in the commit message, and update the relevant ticket.\n2. If a contribution adds new platforms or platform versions, indicate\n3. such in the body of the commit message(s), and update the relevant issues.\n4. When writing commit messages, it is helpful for others if you indicate the issue.\n\n## Community\n\nEGI benefits from a strong community of developers and system administrators, and vice-versa. If you have any questions or if you would like to get involved in the wider EGI community you can check out:\n\n- [EGI Community Forum](https://community.egi.eu/)\n- [EGI website](https://www.egi.eu)\n\nAlso here are some additional pointers to some Ansible documentation:\n\n- [Ansible Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible)\n- [Ansible Container Docs](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-container)\n\n**This file has been modified from the Chef Cookbook Contributing Guide**.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EGI-Federation/ansible-style-guide/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "As a community of practice, we welcome contributions which work smoother and\nhelp us be more inclusive.

Ansible roles are a simple, powerful way to\nexpress the desired state and composition of these services. As with many\nlanguages and tools, a certain amount of leeway is possible when it comes to the\nstyle of implementation. When working on roles, it's a good idea to have common\nnomenclature, follow common styles and adopt common practice regarding\ndocumentation, community engagement, maintenance, support, _etc_. With this\nrepository, we express the consensus view of the\n[EGI Operations team](https://www.egi.eu/internal-services/operations-coordination-and-support/)\nabout how Ansible roles should be developed. It's raisons d'etre are:\n\n- **Improve peer review**: discuss issues of style out-of-band so that when it\n  comes to peer review of pull requests, there is an unambiguous reference. This\n  will help **speed up** peer review, and make it **more attractive** for\n  repository maintainers to actually conduct such peer review. Further it will\n  **encourage contributors**, providing better transparency in the process, and\n  allowing discussion around the style guide itself.\n\n- **Improve reliability, test coverage**: Ansible roles can and should be\n  _tested_ according to common profiles. Infrastructure tests can be expressed\n  in plain language, easy to read, and easy to audit. Test coverage and profiles\n  can be harmonised across roles so that they can be applied modularly with\n  confidence.\n\n- **Promote re-use**: Roles can only be re-used if they are reliable and deliver\n  what they claim to.
