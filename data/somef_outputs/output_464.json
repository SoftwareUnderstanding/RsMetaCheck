2025-10-09\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udf89 New Features\r\n\r\n#### Tools API Environment Variable Support\r\n\r\n- **Automatic Lightweight Mode**: Tools API now automatically detects and respects the `DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_PACKAGE` environment variable\r\n- **No More `make wn_bin`**: When using lightweight mode, you no longer need to build the worker binary package with `make wn_bin` - a huge time saver!\r\n- **Simplified API Usage**: Users no longer need to manually set the `enable_lightweight` flag when the environment variable is set\r\n- **Consistent Behavior**: Tools API now behaves consistently with command-line tools (`dds-session` and `dds-submit`)\r\n- **Smaller Packages**: Worker packages reduced from ~15MB to ~50KB in lightweight mode\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n#### Critical SLURM Plugin Fix for Lightweight Mode\r\n\r\n- **Job Submission Failure**: Fixed critical bug in SLURM plugin that caused job submissions to fail with \"No partition specified or system default partition\" error when using lightweight mode\r\n- **Root Cause**: The job script template incorrectly placed executable validation code before #SBATCH directives, violating SLURM's parsing requirements. SLURM stops processing #SBATCH options when it encounters the first executable line, causing all subsequent directives (including `--partition`) to be ignored\r\n- **Template Bug**: The placeholder `#DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_VALIDATION` appeared in both a comment line and the code section. The `boost::replace_all()` function replaced both occurrences, breaking the comment syntax and injecting executable code before #SBATCH directives\r\n- **Resolution**: \r\n  - Removed lightweight validation code from the job script template entirely\r\n  - Eliminated blank lines between #SBATCH directive placeholders\r\n  - Validation logic moved to worker nodes where it's actually needed (DDSWorker.sh)\r\n- **Impact**: SLURM now correctly parses all #SBATCH directives including partition specifications, resource requirements, and job options\r\n\r\n#### Critical Worker Package Deployment Fix\r\n\r\n- **DDSWorker.sh Logic Error**: Fixed inverted logic bug that caused worker package deployment to fail when pre-compiled binaries were present\r\n- **Impact**: This bug prevented users from deploying full worker packages (with binaries) even though the binaries were correctly packaged\r\n- **Resolution**: The script now correctly:\r\n  - Extracts and uses binaries when they exist (full package mode)\r\n  - Validates lightweight mode requirements when binaries are absent (lightweight package mode)\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\ude80 For Users\r\n\r\n#### If You Use SLURM with Lightweight Mode\r\n\r\nIf you experienced SLURM job submission failures with errors like:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nBatch job submission failed: No partition specified or system default partition\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was caused by a critical bug in the SLURM plugin template that placed executable code before #SBATCH directives. SLURM stopped parsing directives when it encountered this code, ignoring your partition specifications and other settings.\r\n\r\n**The fix requires rebuilding DDS:**\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd /path/to/DDS/build\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter rebuilding, your SLURM submissions with lightweight mode will work correctly, and all #SBATCH directives (including partition, CPU requirements, etc.) will be properly recognized.\r\n\r\n#### If You Use Tools API\r\n\r\nBefore this fix, you had to explicitly set the lightweight flag:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nsubmitInfo.setFlag(SSubmitRequestData::ESubmitRequestFlags::enable_lightweight, true);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, simply set the environment variable before running your application:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_PACKAGE=1\r\n./my_dds_app\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Tools API will automatically:\r\n\r\n- Start sessions with `--lightweight` flag\r\n- Configure submit requests for lightweight mode\r\n\r\n#### If You Experienced Worker Package Failures\r\n\r\nIf you previously encountered errors like:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nError: Can't find WN pre-compiled bin.: /path/to/dds-wrk-bin-3.14-Linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was caused by the DDSWorker.sh bug and is now fixed. Your worker packages will deploy correctly regardless of whether they contain pre-compiled binaries or are in lightweight mode.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udcdd Complete Changelog\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of all changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n---", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FairRootGroup/DDS/tarball/3.16", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FairRootGroup/DDS/zipball/3.16", "html_url": "https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/releases/tag/3.16", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/FairRootGroup/DDS/releases/253260997", "release_id": 253260997, "date_created": "2025-10-09T08:15:12Z", "date_published": "2025-10-09T08:18:12Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/FairRootGroup/DDS/releases/252926591", "tag": "3.15", "author": {"name": "AnarManafov", "type": "User"}, "description": "# Release Notes\r\n\r\n## [3.15.0] - 2025-10-08\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udf89 New Features\r\n\r\n#### Enhanced Documentation and User Experience\r\n\r\n- **Comprehensive Component Documentation**: Added detailed README files for core DDS components including DDS Agent, DDS Intercom Library, and DDS Protocol Library with practical examples and usage patterns\r\n- **DDS Agent Architecture Guide**: New comprehensive documentation covering shared memory transport, task lifecycle management, and internal architecture\r\n- **Intercom Library Examples**: Added practical examples for master-worker coordination, pipeline processing, and event-driven coordination patterns\r\n- **Protocol Library Guide**: Detailed explanation of protocol components, transport layers, and implementation examples\r\n- **Session Management**: Enhanced documentation for lightweight worker package mode and environment variable configuration\r\n- **Submit Tool Improvements**: Better documentation for the `--path` option and improved command descriptions\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udccb Key Documentation Updates\r\n\r\n- **dds-agent**: New comprehensive README with architecture details and usage examples\r\n- **dds-intercom-lib**: Complete API documentation with real-world coordination patterns\r\n- **dds-protocol-lib**: In-depth protocol documentation with transport layer explanations\r\n- **dds-session**: Enhanced README with lightweight session examples and configuration guides\r\n- **dds-submit**: Improved documentation including new `--path` option details\r\n\r\n### \ufffd Build & Packaging Improvements\r\n\r\n- **Optimized Tarball**: System libraries (libc, libm, ld-linux) are now excluded from the tarball to reduce package size and avoid conflicts with system installations\r\n\r\n### \ufffd\ud83d\ude80 For Users\r\n\r\nThese documentation improvements make DDS much easier to understand and use:\r\n\r\n- New users can quickly get started with comprehensive guides\r\n- Advanced users can leverage detailed examples for complex coordination patterns\r\n- System administrators have better understanding of architecture and deployment options\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udcdd Complete Changelog\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of all changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udca1 What's Coming Next\r\n\r\nStay tuned for the official release which will include these documentation enhancements to improve your DDS experience.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## [3.14.0] - 2023-08-23\r\n\r\n### \ud83c\udf89 Major Features\r\n\r\n#### Lightweight Worker Package Support\r\n\r\n- **Faster Deployments**: New lightweight worker package mode reduces package size from ~15MB to ~50KB when DDS is pre-installed on worker nodes\r\n- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Significantly improved deployment efficiency for large-scale distributed computing environments\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\ude80 Key Features\r\n\r\n- **dds-session**: Added `--lightweight` option and `DDS_LIGHTWEIGHT_PACKAGE` environment variable support\r\n- **dds-submit**: New lightweight mode with command-line and environment variable configuration\r\n- **Enhanced Compatibility**: Fixed boost::process compatibility with Boost 1.89+ while maintaining backward compatibility\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udc1b Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- **Boost Compatibility**: Resolved compatibility issues with Boost 1.89+ using conditional compilation\r\n- **Worker Package Validation**: Improved startup logic to handle missing worker packages gracefully\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udca5 Breaking Changes\r\n\r\nNone in this release.\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\udcdd Full Changelog\r\n\r\nFor a complete list of all changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).\r\n\r\n### \ud83d\ude80 How to Upgrade\r\n\r\n1.

Installation\n\nThis guide walks you through building and installing DDS from source code. DDS supports Linux and macOS platforms.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nBefore building DDS, ensure you have:\n\n* C++17 compatible compiler (GCC 7+, Clang 5+, or equivalent)\n* CMake 3.19 or higher\n* BOOST 1.75 or higher\n* Git (for downloading source)\n\nFor detailed third-party dependency information, see [Building 3rd-party Dependencies](./3rd-party.md).\n\n## Step 1: Get the source\n\n* **From DDS git repository**\n\n   ```shell\n   git clone https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS.git DDS-master\n   cd ./DDS-master\n   ```\n\n* **From DDS source tarball**\nUnpack DDS tarball:\n\n   ```shell\n   tar -xzvf DDS-X.Y.Z-Source.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   The tar command will created a new directory ```./DDS-X.Y.Z-Source```, where ```X.Y.Z``` represents a version of DDS.\n\n   ```shell\n   cd ./DDS-X.Y.Z-Source\n   ```\n\n## Step 2: Configure the source\n\nYou can adjust some configuration settings in the BuildSetup.cmake bootstrap file. The following is a list of variables:\n\n| Variable             | Variable                                                                                                                               |\n| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX | Install path prefix, prepended onto install directories.(default ```$HOME/DDS/<DDS_Version>```)                                        |\n| CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     | Set cmake build type. Possible options are: **None**, **Debug**, **Release**, **RelWithDebInfo**, **MinSizeRel** (default **Release**) |\n| BUILD_DOCUMENTATION  | Build source code documentation. Possible options are: **ON**/**OFF** (default **OFF**)                                                |\n| BUILD_TESTS          | Build DDS tests. Possible options are: **ON**/**OFF** (default **OFF**)                                                                |\n\nNow, prepare a build directory for an out-of-source build and configure the source:\n\n```shell\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake -C ../BuildSetup.cmake ..\n```\n\n**Note**  \nIf for some reason, for example a missing dependency, configuration failed. After you get the issue fixed, right before starting the cmake command it is recommended to delete everything in the build directory recursively. This will guaranty a clean build every time the source configuration is restarted.\n\n## Step 3: Build and install\n\nIssue the following commands to build and install DDS:\n\n```shell\nmake -j\nmake install\n```\n\n### Installation Prefix\n\nPlease note, that by default DDS will be installed in ```$HOME/DDS/X.Y.Z```, where ```X.Y.Z``` is a version of DDS. However users can change this behavior by setting the install prefix path in the bootstrap script BuildSetup.cmake. Just uncomment the setting of *CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX* variable and change dummy *MY_PATH_HERE* to a desired path.\n\n### WN package\n\nUsers have a possibility to additionally build DDS worker package for the local platform. In case if you have same OS types on all of the target machines and don't want to use WN packages from the DDS binary repository, just issue:\n\n```shell\nmake -j wn_bin\nmake install\n```\n\nThe commands will build and install a DDS worker package for the given platform.\n\nWe also recommend to build boost without [the icu library](http://site.icu-project.org/) support. This will reduce the size of the WN package dramatically. The following is boost build options you can use to switch of icu:\n\n```shell\n./bootstrap.sh --without-icu ...\n./b2 --disable-icu ...\n```\n\n## Step 4: DDS Environment\n\nIn order to enable DDS's environment you need to source the DDS_env.sh script. Change to your newly installed DDS directory and issue:\n\n```shell\ncd [DDS INSTALL DIRECTORY]\nsource DDS_env.sh\n```\n\nYou need to source this script every time before using DDS in a new system shell. Simplify it by sourcing the script in your bash profile.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/master/docs/install.md"}], "has_script_file": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/master/dds-tutorials/dds-tutorial3/run_tutorial3.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/master/etc/DDS_env.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/master/utils/update_format.sh", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/master/.github/workflows/fair-software.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "commandline-application", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 0.82, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "1. **Install DDS**: [Installation Guide](./docs/install.md)\n2. **First Run**: [Quick Start Guide](./docs/quick-start.md)\n3. **Learn by Example**: [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials.md)\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Quick Start", "parent_header": ["The Dynamic Deployment System (DDS)"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/blob/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "* [Requirements](./docs/requirements.md) - System and network requirements\n* [Download](./docs/download.md) - Get DDS releases\n* [Installation](./docs/install.md) - Build and install from source\n* [Quick Start](./docs/quick-start.md) - Run your first DDS deployment\n* [How to Start](./docs/how-to-start.md) - Detailed usage guide\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Getting Started", "parent_header": ["The Dynamic Deployment System (DDS)", "Documentation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/blob/master/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "* [User Defaults Configuration](./docs/user-defaults-configuration.md) - Customize DDS behavior\n* [Topology description](./dds-topology-lib/README.md) - Define your task workflows  \n* [Tutorials](./docs/tutorials.md) - Step-by-step examples\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Configuration and Usage", "parent_header": ["The Dynamic Deployment System (DDS)", "Documentation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/blob/master/README.md"}], "identifier": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/16586922"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/blob/master/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "The Dynamic Deployment System (DDS)"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/FairRootGroup/DDS/blob/master/README.md"}]}
