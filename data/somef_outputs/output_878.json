This makes it frustrating for beginners and advanced Python analysts-alike to jump between different tools in order to accomplish a single task. So, rather than completely reinvent the wheel, `pymer4` aims to bring the best R's robust modeling capabilities to Python for the most common General(ized)-Linear-(Mixed)-Modeling (GLMMs) needs in the social and behavioral sciences.  \nAt the same time, `pymer4` includes numerous *quality-of-life features* for common tasks you're likely to do when working with models (e.g. automatically calculated fit statistics, residuals, p-values for mixed-models, bootstrapped confidence-intervals, random-effects deviances, etc). By bringing together functionality spread across several popular R tools, we've aimed for *intuitive-usability*. `pymer4` also notably builds on top of the [`polars`](https://docs.pola.rs/py-polars/html/reference/) Dataframe library rather than `pandas`.

"installation": [{"result": {"value": "# Installation\n\n:::{admonition} **Do NOT use `pip`**\n:class: danger\nDue to the cross-language nature of `pymer4` installing via `pip` is **not officially supported**.  \nPlease use one of the two options below.\n:::\n\n:::{admonition} ATTENTION: Windows Users\n:class: info, dropdown\n*Unfortunately, Windows it not officially supported as package installation can be unreliable. We recommend using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and setting up a conda install through there. Alternatively you can try to follow [this guide](https://joonro.github.io/blog/posts/install-rpy2-windows-10/) to setup an R installation with the `rpy2` Python library.*\n:::\n\n## 1. Using Anaconda\n\n*If you don't already have Anaconda/Miniconda setup, follow first follow the instructions [here](https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/miniconda/install)*\n\n\nTo install into existing environment use\n\n```bash\nconda install -c ejolly -c conda-forge pymer4\n```\n\nTo create a new environment with additional scientific Python libraries\n\n```bash\nconda create --n pymer4 -c ejolly -c conda-forge pymer4\n```\n\nYou can test the installation by running the following command in a terminal within the environment you installed `pymer4`\n\n```bash\npython -c \"from pymer4 import test_install; test_install()\"\n```\n\n:::{note}\nThe `-c conda-forge` in the the `conda` commands above ensures that additional dependencies for `pymer4` are installed via the `conda-forge` channel which contains the relevant R packages, rather than Anaconda `defaults` which does not.\n:::\n\n## 2. Using Pixi\n\n[Pixi.sh](https://pixi.sh/latest/python/tutorial/) is a new modern Python package and environment manager that works with [`uv`]() and `conda-forge` allowing you mix-and-match `pip` and `conda` packages. It uses a `pyproject.toml` file as the *blueprints* for an *isolated* environment and python package. Rather than updating that file yourself, you use various [pixi commands](../development/design.md#additional-pixi-commands) which will keep this file up-to-date. This works similarily to [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) in Javascript.\n\nAfter [installing pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/#installation), you can create a fresh project called `myproject` using:\n\n```bash\npixi init --format pyproject --channel ejolly --channel conda-forge myproject\n```\n\nThen just install `pymer4` using:\n\n```bash\npixi add pymer4\n```\n\nAll the changes you make with `pixi` commands like `add` modify the `pyproject.toml` file. For example, we can add additional dependencies, e.g. jupyter notebook support, plotting, etc:\n\n```bash\npixi add seaborn ipykernel\n```\n\nOr packages from `pip`:\n\n```bash\npixi add --pypi polars\n```\n\nWhich will produce a file like this tracking our channels (`ejolly`, `conda-forge`, `pip`), dependencies, and versions:\n\n```toml\n[project]\nauthors = [{ name = \"ejolly\", email = \"eshin.jolly@gmail.com\" }]\nname = \"myproject\"\nrequires-python = \">= 3.11\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\ndependencies = [\"polars\"]\n\n[build-system]\nbuild-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\nrequires = [\"hatchling\"]\n\n[tool.pixi.workspace]\nchannels = [\"ejolly\", \"conda-forge\"]\nplatforms = [\"osx-arm64\"]\n\n[tool.pixi.pypi-dependencies]\nmyproject = { path = \".\", editable = true }\n\n[tool.pixi.tasks]\n\n[tool.pixi.dependencies]\npymer4 = \">=0.9.1,<0.10\"\nipykernel = \">=6.29.5,<7\"\nseaborn = \">=0.13.2,<0.14\"\n```\n\nWe can simply place this file and the associated `pixi.lock` under version control and our environment becomes fully reproducible with `pixi install` !\n\n\n## 3. Using Google Collab\n\nIf you are having trouble or don't want to install `pymer4` *locally*, you can use it in a Google Colab notebook by following the directions below. Or you can just copy the [Example Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/19D15LAid9GgqSm9kU_TXy9ERUM7mBvnN?usp=sharing) that we've setup. \n\n\n### Manually setting up `conda` on Collab \n\nIn the first cell of your note book add the following code and run it. This will cause your notebook kernel to appear to \"crash\" and restart - **this is expected**\n\n```bash\n!pip install -q condacolab\nimport condacolab\ncondacolab.install()\n```\n\n### Installing `pymer4`\n\nOnce the kernel restarts, you'll have the `!mamba` command available that you can use to install `pymer4`. You don't need to rerun the previous cell. Just create and run a new cell below it with the following code:\n\n```bash\n!mamba install -q pymer4 -c ejolly -c conda-forge\n```\n\nThen you should be all set!\n\n## Using the development version of `pymer4`\n\nTo support easy installation of the latest \"bleeding-edge\" version of `pymer4` on the `main` branch of Github you can use the command below to install from the `pre-release` channel on anaconda.org. The `main` branch may often contain upcoming fixes and features slated for a new release.\n\n```bash\nconda install -c ejolly/label/pre-release -c conda-forge pymer4\n```\n\n## Installation issues on intel macOS\n\nSome of the more cryptic error messages you might encounter on macOS are\ndue to compiler issues that give `rpy2` (a package dependency of\n`pymer4`) some issues during install. Here\\'s a fix that should work for\nthat:\n\n1.  Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) if you don\\'t have it already\n    by running the command at the link (it\\'s a great pacakage manager\n    for macOS). To check if you already have it, do `which brew` in your\n    Terminal. If nothing pops up you don\\'t have it.\n\n2.  Fix brew permissions: `sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*`\n    (this is **necessary** on macOS Sierra or higher (\\>= macOS 10.12))\n\n3.  Update homebrew `brew update`\n\n4.  Install the xz utility `brew install xz`\n\n5.  At this point you can try to re-install `pymer4` and re-test the\n    installation. If it still doesn\\'t work follow the next few steps\n    below\n\n6.  Install an updated compiler: `brew install gcc`, or if you have\n    homebrew already, `brew upgrade gcc`\n\n7.  Enable the new compiler for use:\n\n    ``` bash\n    export CC=\"$(find `brew info gcc | grep usr | sed 's/(.*//' | awk '{printf $1\"/bin\"}'` -name 'x86*gcc-?')\"\n    export CFLAGS=\"-W\"\n    ```\n\n8.  If the above results in any error output (it should return nothing)\n    you might need to manually find out where the new compiler is\n    installed. To do so use `brew info gcc` and `cd` into the directory\n    that begins with `/usr` in the output of that command. From there\n    `cd` into `bin` and look for a file that begins with `x86` and ends\n    with `gcc-7`. It\\'s possible that the directory ends with `gcc-8` or\n    a higher number based on how recently you installed from homebrew.\n    In that case, just use the latest version. Copy the *full path* to\n    that file and run the following:\n\n    ``` bash\n    export CC= pathYouCopiedInQuotes\n    export CFLAGS=\"-W\"\n    ```\n\n9.  Finally install `rpy2` using the new compiler you just installed:\n    `pip install rpy2` if you have R/RStudio or\n    `conda install -c conda-forge rpy2` if you don\\'t.\n\n10. Now you should be able to `pip install pymer4` :)\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ejolly/pymer4/main/docs/pages/installation.md"}], "contributing_guidelines": [{"result": {"value": "# How to Contribute\n\nWe **always welcome contributions** and have tried to simplify the process of adding new features or fixing bugs to `pymer4`.
