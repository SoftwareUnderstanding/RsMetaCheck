This is problematic for multiple reasons. The first is that mononyms are common in many countries: a person's name may legitimately be only a single word which is not conceptually a \"given\" or \"family\" name.  To compound the difficulty for IGA, names are stored as single fields in GitHub account metadata, so unless a repository has a `codemeta.json` or `CITATION.cff` file (which allow authors more control over how they want their names represented), IGA is forced to try to split the single GitHub name string into two parts. _A foolproof algorithm for doing this does not exist_, so IGA will sometimes get it wrong. (That said, IGA goes to extraordinary lengths to try to do a good job.)\n* InvenioRDM requires that identities (creators, contributors, etc.) to be labeled as personal or organizational. The nature of identities is usually made clear in `codemeta.json` and `CITATION.cff` files. GitHub also provides a flag that is meant to be used to label organizational accounts, but sometimes people don't set the GitHub account information correctly. Consequently, if IGA has to use GitHub data to get (e.g.) the list of contributors on a project, it may mislabel identities in the InvenioRDM record it produces.\n* Some accounts on GitHub are software automation or \"bot\" accounts, but are not labeled as such. These accounts are generally indistinguishable from human accounts on GitHub, so if they're not labeled as bot or organizational accounts in GitHub, IGA can't recognize that they're humans. If such an account is the creator of a release in GitHub, and IGA tries to use its name-splitting algorithm on the name of the account, it may produce a nonsensical result. For example, it might turn \"Travis CI\" into an entry with a first name of \"Travis\" and last name of \"CI\".\n* Funder and funding information can only be specified in `codemeta.json` files; neither GitHub nor `CITATION.cff` have provisions to store this kind of metadata. The CodeMeta specification defines two fields for this purpose: `funder` and `funding`. Unfortunately, these map imperfectly to the requirements of InvenioRDM's metadata format. In addition, people don't always follow the CodeMeta guidelines, and sometimes they write funding information as text strings (instead of structured objects), the interpretation of which would require software that can recognize grant and funding agency information from free-text descriptions. This combination of factors means IGA often can't fill in the funding metadata in InvenioRDM records even if there is some funding information in the `codemeta.json` file. \n", "original_header":

Two of our dependencies are directly affected by this:\n* It prevents us from having our `requirements.txt` install our [patched version of `pybtex-apa7-style`](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/pybtex-apa7-style) unless we also release that package on PyPI. Doing so is undesirable, so we have to vendor the package within IGA's codebase. (A detailed explanation of the problem can be found in the [README file in `iga/vendor`](./iga/vendor/README.md).\n* SpaCy models are only available from spaCy's GitHub repository and not as packages installable using `pip`. Since we can't have them as direct references in our `requirements.txt` file, IGA has to download spaCy models it needs at run-time the first time it needs them. The change to IGA means that we take a huge (but thankfully one-time) performance hit the first time spaCy is needed, but at least it'll happen only once and not again on subsequent runs of IGA.\n\nOther changes in this release:\n* Update the versions of some dependencies in `requirements.txt`.\n* Improve trapping and reporting of internal errors during network calls.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/tarball/v0.0.4", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/zipball/v0.0.4", "html_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/tag/v0.0.4", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/98611897", "release_id": 98611897, "date_created": "2023-04-08T03:16:53Z", "date_published": "2023-04-08T03:20:23Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/98483552", "tag": "v0.0.3", "name": "Release 0.0.3", "author": {"name": "mhucka", "type": "User"}, "description": "This release fixes a problem with the syntax of `setup.py` that prevented installations via `pip install git+https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga.git`.\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/tarball/v0.0.3", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/zipball/v0.0.3", "html_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/tag/v0.0.3", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/98483552", "release_id": 98483552, "date_created": "2023-04-07T01:56:18Z", "date_published": "2023-04-07T01:56:53Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/98482627", "tag": "v0.0.2", "name": "Release 0.0.2", "author": {"name": "mhucka", "type": "User"}, "description": "Fixes:\n* Fix issue #1: error if `--mode` option is not given.\n* Fix missing dependencies in `requirements-dev.txt`.\n* Fix parsing of https dependencies in `setup.py`.\n* Fix bug in `requirements.txt` that caused loading the wrong copy of `pybtex-apa7-style`.\n* Fix missing spaCy requirements in `requirements.txt`.\n* Fix name tagging algorithm to account for changes in spaCy behavior in latest Transformer models.\n* Fix tests that had gotten out of sync with the codebase.\n\nChanges:\n* (Hopefully) improve colors and readability of help text printed with `--help`.\n* More documentation (still a work in progress).\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/tarball/v0.0.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/zipball/v0.0.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/tag/v0.0.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/caltechlibrary/iga/releases/98482627", "release_id": 98482627, "date_created": "2023-04-07T01:27:22Z", "date_published": "2023-04-07T01:29:48Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "cff-version: 1.2.0\nmessage: \"If you use this software, please cite it as below.\"\ntitle: InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA)\nauthors:\n  - family-names: Hucka\n    given-names: Michael\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9105-5960\n  - family-names: Morrell\n    given-names: Thomas E\n    orcid: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9266-5146\nabstract: The InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA) automatically archives GitHub releases in an InvenioRDM repository.\nrepository-code: \"https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga\"\ntype: software\ndoi: 10.22002/7vcz4-d4p68\nversion: 1.3.5\nlicense-url: \"https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/blob/main/LICENSE\"\nkeywords:\n  - software\n  - science\n  - archiving\n  - archives\n  - preservation\n  - source code\n  - source code archiving\n  - source code preservation\n  - code preservation\n  - automation\n  - reproducibility\n  - research reproducibility\n  - InvenioRDM\n  - Invenio\n  - GitHub\n  - GitHub Actions\n  - GitHub Automation\ndate-released: 2025-10-16\n", "type": "File_dump", "author": [{"type": "Agent", "name": "Michael Hucka", "family_name": "Hucka", "given_name": "Michael", "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9105-5960"}, {"type": "Agent", "name": "Thomas E Morrell", "family_name": "Morrell", "given_name": "Thomas E", "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9266-5146"}], "title": "InvenioRDM GitHub Archiver (IGA)", "url": "https://doi.org/10.22002/7vcz4-d4p68", "doi": "10.22002/7vcz4-d4p68", "format": "cff", "datePublished": "2025"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/CITATION.cff"}], "license": [{"result": {"value": "Copyright (c) 2022-2024, Caltech\nAll rights not granted herein are expressly reserved by Caltech.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

This is often the easiest approach to getting Python on your machine.  If that's not suitable for you for any reason, continue reading!\n\n\n## A note about Python version issues\n\nIt may be possible to use the default copy of Python provided by your operating system if it happens to be a version 3 edition of Python.  As of January 2021, the [oldest still-supported version of Python is 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  However, for historical reasons, many operating system distributions still ship with Python version 2.7 even today. This can be confusing, because the default `python` and `pip` commands provided on these operating systems is version 2.7 of Python; attempting to run programs written for Python version 3 with version 2.7 can result in extremely confusing errors that bear no relationship to the _actual_ problem, which is that the program is not written to run in Python 2.7.\n\n\n## Installing a recent version of Python and `pip`\n\nOn some systems, version 3.x of the Python interpreter and `pip` are available using the commands `python3` and `pip3`, respectively. More often, they must be installed separately.  The following subsections describe how Python 3 can be installed either using the standard software package managers on certain popular operating systems, or using third-party software managers.\n\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu\n\nDebian-based systems still ship with older versions of Python by\ndefault. To install a modern version of Python and the associated version of `pip`, run the following command:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt install python3 python3-pip\n```\n\n### macOS\n\nThe version of Python that comes with macOS through at least macOS 10.15 (Catalina) is Python 2.7.  The most convenient way to get Python 3.x and the associated version of `pip` is to use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) or [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), depending on your preference.\n\n\n#### _Using MacPorts_\n\nIf you are using macOS and MacPorts, the following command will install a recent version of Python 3:\n\n```shell\nsudo port install python3 py38-pip\n```\n\nAfter running the command above, you should be able to invoke the Python interpreter using the command `python3`. You can verify the version of Python and `pip` with the following commands:\n\n```shell\npython3 --version\npython3 -m pip --version\n```\n\n#### _Using HomeBrew_\n\nIf you are using [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh), the corresponding commands are as follows:\n\n```shell\nbrew install python3\n```\n\nHomeBrew's Python 3 package installs `pip3` by default.  Unless you configured your copy of HomeBrew to install it elsewhere, programs should end up in `/usr/local/bin` on your computer.  Look for `pip3` there (e.g., by running the command `ls /usr/local/bin/pip*` to see what gets listed).\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/INSTALL-Python3.md"}, {"result": {"value": "# Installation\n\nIGA can be installed as either (or both) a command-line program on your computer or a [GitHub Action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) in a GitHub repository.\n\n## IGA as a normal program\n\nPlease choose an approach that suits your situation and preferences.

In the `.github/workflows` directory, create a file named (e.g.) `iga.yml` and copy the following content (which is also available as file [`sample-workflow.yml`](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/blob/v1/sample-workflow.yml) in the GitHub repository for IGA):\n    ```{literalinclude} ../sample-workflow.yml\n    :language: yaml\n    ```\n3. **Edit the value of the `INVENIO_SERVER` variable near the top of the file above** \u2191.

If you have a [CodeMeta](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/iga/introduction.html#codemeta-citation-cff) file, the GitHub action workflow can automatically add the DOI after IGA has run. The \"ref\" value is the branch where the CodeMeta file will be updated. If you don't use a CodeMeta file, you can delete the `add_doi_codemeta` part of the workflow.\n6.

participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject contributors are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject contributors have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project contributors.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nIf a contributor engages in harassing behaviour, the project organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from online forums, online project resources, face-to-face meetings, or any other project-related activity or resource.\n\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the project team immediately.  Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.  Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\n## Attribution\n\nPortions of this Code of Conduct were adapted from Electron's [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which itself was adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4), version 1.4.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "documentation": [{"result": {"value": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/tree/develop/docs", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "has_package_file": [{"result": {"value": "pyproject.toml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/iga/vendor/pybtex_apa7_style/pyproject.toml"}], "package_id": [{"result": {"value": "pybtex-apa7-style", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/iga/vendor/pybtex_apa7_style/pyproject.toml"}], "runtime_platform": [{"result": {"value": "^3.9", "name": "Python", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "code_parser", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/iga/vendor/pybtex_apa7_style/pyproject.toml"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/.github/workflows/doc-builder.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/.github/workflows/waystation.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/.github/workflows/iga.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/.github/workflows/python-linter.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/.github/workflows/bad-link-reporter.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/iga/develop/.github/workflows/markdown-linter.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "commandline-application", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 0.82, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "No matter whether IGA is run locally on your computer or as a GitHub Actions workflow, in both cases it must be provided with a personal access token (PAT) for your InvenioRDM server.

Four run modes are available: `quiet`, `normal`, `verbose`, and `debug`. The default mode is `normal`, in which IGA prints a few messages while it's working. The mode `quiet` will make it avoid printing anything unless an error occurs, the mode `verbose` will make it print a detailed trace of what it is doing, and the mode `debug` will make IGA even more verbose. In addition, in `debug` mode, IGA will drop into the `pdb` debugger if it encounters an exception during execution. On Linux and macOS, debug mode also installs a signal handler on signal USR1 that causes IGA to drop into the `pdb` debugger if the signal USR1 is received. (Use `kill -USR1 NNN`, where NNN is the IGA process id.)\n\nBy default, informational output is sent to the standard output (normally the terminal console). The option `--log-dest` can be used to send the output to the given destination instead. The value can be `-` (i.e., a dash) to indicate console output, or it can be a file path to send the output to the file. A special exception is that even if a log destination is given, IGA will still print the final record URL to stdout.  This makes it possible to invoke IGA from scripts that capture the record URL while still saving diagnostic output in case debugging is needed.\n\nBy default, IGA prints only the record URL when done. The option `--print-doi` will make it also print the DOI of the record. (Note that this only works when publishing records; if options `--draft` or `--community` are used, then there will be no DOI. In those case, only the URL will be printed.)\n\nReading and writing large files may take a long time; on the other hand, IGA should not wait forever on network operations before reporting an error if a server or network becomes unresponsive. To balance these conflicting needs, IGA automatically scales its network timeout based on file sizes. To override its adaptive algorithm and set an explicit timeout value, use the option `--timeout` with a value in seconds.\n\nIf given the `--version` option, this program will print its version and other information, and exit without doing anything else.\n\nRunning IGA with the option `--help` will make it print help text and exit without doing anything else.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Other options recognized by IGA", "parent_header": ["IGA<img alt=\"IGA logo\" width=\"12%\" align=\"right\" src=\"https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/raw/main/docs/_static/media/cloud-upload.png\">", "Usage"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://github.com/caltechlibrary/iga/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "This program exits with a return status code of 0 if no problem is encountered.

Here is how:\n\n1. _After_ you have at least one release archived in your InvenioRDM server, find out the DOI of that release in InvenioRDM, and extract the tail end of that DOI. The DOI assigned by InvenioRDM will be a string such as `10.22002/zsmem-2pg20`; the tail end is the `zsmem-2pg20` part. (Your DOI and tail portion will be different.)\n2. Let <i><b><code>SERVERURL</code></b></i> stand for the URL for your InvenioRDM server, and let <i><b><code>IDENTIFIER</code></b></i> stand for the identifier portion of the DOI. In your `README.md` file, write the DOI badge as follows (without line breaks):\n\n    <pre><code>[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=DOI&query=$.pids.doi.identifier&uri=<i><b><code>SERVERURL</code></b></i>/api/records/<i><b><code>IDENTIFIER</code></b></i>/versions/latest)](<i><b><code>SERVERURL</code></b></i>/records/<i><b><code>IDENTIFIER</code></b></i>/latest)</code></pre>\n\nFor example, for CaltechDATA and the archived IGA releases there,\n\n* <i><b><code>SERVERURL</code></b></i> = `http://data.caltech.edu`\n* <i><b><code>IDENTIFIER</code></b></i> = `zsmem-2pg20`\n\nwhich leads to the following badge string for IGA's `README.md` file:\n\n```txt\n[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=DOI&query=$.pids.doi.identifier&uri=https://data.caltech.edu/api/records/zsmem-2pg20/versions/latest)](https://data.caltech.edu/records/zsmem-2pg20/latest)\n```\n\n<br>The result looks like this: <div align=\"center\">\n\n[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json.svg?label=DOI&query=$.pids.doi.identifier&uri=https://data.caltech.edu/api/records/zsmem-2pg20/versions/latest)](https://data.caltech.edu/records/zsmem-2pg20/latest)\n\n</div>\n\nYou can change the look of the badge by using style parameters.
