of contributions are very welcome!\nYou can contribute in various ways, e.g. by\n\n-   providing feedback\n-   asking questions\n-   suggesting ideas\n-   implementing features\n-   fixing problems\n-   improving documentation\n\nTo make contributing to open source projects a good experience to everyone involved,\nplease make sure that you follow our code of conduct when communicating with others.\n\n## Ideas, Questions and Problems\n\nIf you have questions or difficulties using this software,\nplease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/fair-python-cookiecutter/issues).\n\nIf your topic is not already covered by an existing issue,\nplease create a new issue using one of the provided issue templates.\n\nIf your issue is caused by incomplete, unclear or outdated documentation,\nwe are also happy to get suggestions on how to improve it.\nOutdated or incorrect documentation is a _bug_,\nwhile missing documentation is a _feature request_.\n\n**NOTE:** If you want to report a critical security problem, _do not_ open an issue!\nInstead, please create a [private security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability),\nor contact the current package maintainers directly by e-mail.\n\n## Development\n\nThis project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.\n\nYou can run the following lines to check out the project and prepare it for development:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/Materials-Data-Science-and-Informatics/fair-python-cookiecutter.git\ncd fair-python-cookiecutter\npoetry install --with docs\npoetry run poe init-dev\n```\n\nCommon tasks are accessible via [poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet):\n\n-   Use `poetry run poe lint` to run linters manually, add `--all-files` to check everything.\n\n-   Use `poetry run poe test` to run tests, add `--cov` to also show test coverage.\n\n-   Use `poetry run poe docs` to generate local documentation\n\nIn order to contribute code, please open a pull request.\n\nBefore opening the PR, please make sure that your changes\n\n-   are sufficiently covered by meaningful **tests**,\n-   are reflected in suitable **documentation** (API docs, guides, etc.), and\n-   successfully pass all pre-commit hooks.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":
