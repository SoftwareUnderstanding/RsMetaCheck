As an international community, we are sensitive to many different social and cultural norms around language and behaviour, and we strive to conduct ourselves, online and in person, in ways that are unlikely to cause offense. AI4LAM members communicate primarily in English, recognising that English is not the native language for many in the community. We therefore strive to express ourselves simply and clearly, remembering that unnecessary use of jargon and slang will be a barrier to understanding for many of our colleagues. We recognize that not everyone may want or be able to travel internationally for AI4LAM events, and we strive to provide opportunities for remote participation whenever possible.\n\n## Anti-Harassment\n\nWe are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. The AI4LAM community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free collaboration experience for everyone regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, faith, or anything else. We do not tolerate harassment of community participants in any form. Sexual or discriminatory language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue, including event presentations, email lists, teleconferences, and in-person gatherings. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled at the discretion of the event of community coordinators, and their details provided to partner institutions.\n\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Offensive verbal comments, insults, or jokes related to physical or intellectual ability, gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, etc.\n* Discriminatory images in public spaces, including but not limited to sexually explicit or violent material\n* Deliberate intimidation, violent threats or language directed against another person\n* Stalking, or unwanted following\n* Harassing photography or recording\n* Sustained disruption of talks or other communication\n* Inappropriate or unwanted physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention\n* Posting (or threatening to post) other people\u2019s personally identifying information\n* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour\n* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop\n\nAs this document outlines, participants in the AI4LAM community seek to foster a positive and supportive environment. We pride ourselves on building a productive, happy, and flexible community that can welcome new ideas in a complex field and foster collaboration between groups that ultimately share the same needs, interests, and goals.\n\nIndividuals who violate these guidelines will be notified and asked to change their behaviour. Repeated violations may result in loss of membership in project groups, revocation of special access to project resources, and/or loss of access to project communication channels (AI4LAM-Discuss email list, Slack channels, and others). Repeat offenders may be asked to stop participating or directed to filter their participation through another member of their institution (if applicable).\n\nIf a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender, or immediate expulsion from the event or communication channel. Participants asked, by anyone, to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.\n\n## Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the event organizing team and/or AI4LAM Secretariat ([secretariat@ai4lam.org](secretariat@ai4lam.org)). If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate, please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.github/workflows/yaml-linter.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.github/workflows/bad-link-reporter.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.github/workflows/markdown-linter.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "non-software", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "application_domain": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Semantic web"}, "confidence": 0.8440774582649828, "technique": "supervised_classification"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Awesome AI for LAM"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}], "images": [{"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/awesome-list-badge.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition-small.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/suggest-addition.svg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Url", "value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AI4LAM/awesome-ai4lam/main/.graphics/cc0.jpg"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://github.com/mhucka/awesome-ai4lam/blob/main/README.md"}]}
