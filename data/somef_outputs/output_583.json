Please pay attention to the deprecation warnings listed below.\r\n* Patch changes were made to `random_mctq()` to avoid warning messages due to [`lubridate`](https://github.com/tidyverse/lubridate) package updates.\r\n* The utility functions `assign_date()`, `cycle_time()`, `round_time()`, `shorter_interval()`, `longer_interval()`, `shorter_duration()`, `longer_duration()`, `sum_time()`, and `vct_sum_time()` are now deprecated.  These functions will be removed on the next `mctq` version. You can still find them in the [`lubritime`](https://github.com/giperbio/lubritime) package.\r\n* The utility function `qplot_walk()` is now deprecated. This function will be removed on the next `mctq` version. You can still find it in the\r\n  [`gutils`](https://github.com/giperbio/gutils) package.\r\n* `qplot_walk()` now uses `ggplot2::geom_bar()` or `ggplot2::geom_histogram()` to generate plots. It used `ggplot2::qplot()` before, now deprecated.\r\n* The `ggplot2` package was added as an import. It's needed while `qplot_walk()` remains on the package and will be removed from imports in the next `mctq` version.\r\n* Mario Pedrazzoli and Ana Amelia Benedito-Silva were removed as authors. They were Scientific Advisers that helped with the initial `mctq` development, but are not part of the `mctq` project anymore.\r\n* The Interdisciplinary Sleep Research Group (GIPSO) was removed as funder. GIPSO is a research group that Mario and Daniel Vartanian have built together. Daniel (the main author and copyright holder of `mctq`) is no longer part of this group.

We are not directly funded to do so.\n\n[repo]: https://github.com/ropensci/mctq\n[issues]: https://github.com/ropensci/mctq/issues\n[discussions]: https://github.com/ropensci/mctq/discussions\n[new_issue]: https://github.com/ropensci/mctq/issues/new\n[new_discussion]: https://github.com/ropensci/mctq/discussions/new\n[website]: https://docs.ropensci.org/mctq\n[citation]: https://docs.ropensci.org/mctq/authors.html\n[email]: mailto:danvartan@gmail.com\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nPlease note that this package is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://ropensci.org/code-of-conduct/). By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know more about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see this [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).\n\nThis package generally uses the rOpenSci packaging guidelines for style and structure.\n\n### Share the love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThink `mctq` is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person, via Twitter or a blog post.\n\nUsing `mctq` for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing it][citation].\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing `mctq` and got stuck? Browse the [documentation][website] to see if you can find a solution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [new discussion on GitHub][new_discussion]. While we cannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions often lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by [email][email].\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new `mctq` feature? Take a look at the [documentation][website] and [discussion list][discussions] to see if it isn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [discussion on GitHub][new_discussion]. While we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing `mctq` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have the same experience and report it as an [issue on GitHub][new_issue] so we can fix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please include:\n\n* The content of `utils::sessionInfo()`.\n* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.\n* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug (tip: use [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)).\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example? Good documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very welcome!\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website][website] is generated with [`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any html: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes, [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the package `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around `pkgdown`, you can [propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to improve documentation. If not, [start a discussion][new_discussion] so that we can point you in the right direction.\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to documentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you want to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code repository][repo].\n2. Look for the file with the function.\n3. [Propose a file change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/) to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `mctq`? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f Have a look at the [issue list][issues] and leave a comment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines below.\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo][repo] and clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/) to your clone by using `git pull upstream main`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors, warnings and notes.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n\nAlso note that we use the [rOpenSci packaging guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/packaging_guide.md), [tidyverse design guide](https://principles.tidyverse.org/), and [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/). Your code must conform to this principles and rules.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/mctq/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "We welcome contributions, including bug reports.
