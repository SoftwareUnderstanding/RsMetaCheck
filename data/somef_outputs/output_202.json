If you change the name of\nthe code that calculates the transits, you'll need to change it here,\ntoo, as the target of the form.   If you want to change the appearance\nof the input form, or add observatories, you can edit this file.  Note\nthat it is not just an HTML file, but rather an mixture of Perl code\nand HTML; though most of the form is hard-coded and is easily edited\nhere, the exact form is generated on the fly by execution of the Perl\ncode.  This allows, for example, filling in the user's default\nselections for observatory location, transit elevation, etc., by\nreading the stored cookies and using them to set the form values. \n\nFor the transit-calculating code, you'll find a section near the top\nof the file that gives instructions for customizing it for your\nsetup.  You need to change a few variables there to point to your\ntarget file and to give your contact info for error messages.  You\nalso may need to edit a few subroutines at the end of the file to\nspecify where your finding charts (if any) are, and how to format\nlinks to web pages giving more information about your targets.  (Note:\nthe default output template includes links to finding charts on\nSkyMap.org, and to target info at Simbad and 2MASS - if that's enough\nfor your purposes, you can set both of these functions to return\n`undef`.   Most importantly, you'll need to look at the routine that\nparses a line of input from the datafile into separate fields that\ngives target information (coords, ephemeris, etc.).  You'll need\neither to make sure that your input file conforms to that expected\nformat, or to change the format there to match your file.  \n\nRegarding target format files, I've also supplied two auxiliary\nscripts that give examples of how to access target info from other\nlocations on the web and convert them to the format expected by this\nscript.  One can access a target list that is stored in a Google Docs\nspreadsheet, using the column headings to identify the fields.  The\nsecond parses the CSV file supplied by exoplanets.org into this target\nformat.  (To see an implementation of the script that uses the latter\ntarget list, go to https://astro.swarthmore.edu/transits.cgi .)  If you\nwanted to avoid storing a local target list altogether, and only use\nan on-line spreadsheet, it wouldn't be too hard to combine the code\nthat fetches and parses the Google spreadsheet with the code in the\nmain routine - you'd just need to replace the file open / file read\ncalls in the main routine with a call to the separate\nspreadsheet-reading code.  (If anyone does this in a way that makes it\neasy to choose either mode, please send me a patch!) \n\nThough the main focus of the code is periodic events like transits or\neclipses, it can also handle non-periodic events.  For these \"any\ntime\" targets, the code just calculates whether or not they are above\nsome minimum elevation at some point during the night.  To designate a\ntarget as non-periodic, give it a value of \"2\" in the \"photometry\nrequested\" field.  A value of \"1\" denotes a periodic target, and a\nvalue of \"3\" is both \"1\" and \"2\", i.e. a target for which the transit\nephemeris should be used to report transits, but for which overall\nvisibility should be calculated and reported as well, e.g. for\nout-of-transit monitoring. \n\nThe appearance of the output (the table of upcoming transits) is\nlargely governed by a template file, `target_table.tmpl`, so this is the\nplace to customize the output if you don't like the defaults.  See the\ndocumentation for `HTML::Template` for more details, but briefly, this\nfile specifies HTML code with special tags that are replaced by the\nvalues of Perl variables at run time.  There are loops in the template\nfile that are executed at run time over all visible targets, i.e. the\ncode in the template is for one given row, but it is repeated as many\ntimes as necessary, with the values filled in for a particular target.\nThere is an `HTML::Template` tutorial at\nhttps://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=65642 .\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Setup:", "parent_header": ["Tapir: Observation planning software"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elnjensen/Tapir/master/README.md"}], "citation": [{"result": {"value": "If you find this code useful for your work, please consider citing the\nAstronomy Source Code Library entry, https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ascl.soft06007J .\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Citing:", "parent_header": ["Tapir: Observation planning software"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elnjensen/Tapir/master/README.md"}], "acknowledgement": [{"result": {"value": "Many thanks to the authors of various packages that made this work\npossible, especially Tim Jenness for Astro::Coords, Astro::Telescope,\nand Astro::PAL, and the various contributors to the DateTime and\nHTML::Template packages. \n\nThanks to Jason Wright and his team for the exoplanets.org database,\nand to STScI for providing access to the Digitized Sky Survey. \n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Acknowledgments:", "parent_header": ["Tapir: Observation planning software"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elnjensen/Tapir/master/README.md"}], "full_title": [{"result": {"type": "String", "value": "Tapir: Observation planning software"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "regular_expression", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elnjensen/Tapir/master/README.md"}]}
