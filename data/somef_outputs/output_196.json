In conjunction with a note,\nspecifying a unique pitch requires the octave number, either in tick\nformat (comma and single quote, `c, c c'`) or integer format\n(`c2 c c4`). Octave 3 is the implicit default; there is no tick in tick\nformat and explicitly adding the `3` in integer format is unnecessary.\nThe pitches `c d e f g a b` (default octave) are the notes in the octave\nbelow middle C (`c'`). \nYou\u2019ve already seen above with the example using a music object that a\nnoteworthy string can be one part of a more complete piece of musical\ninformation.

No more relative transposed keys. Now takes an explicit `key` argument that overrides the global `key` from sheet music render functions. Other arguments simplified and rearranged.\r\n* Refactored many package functions. Most behavior unchanged, but some breaking changes were made based on intentional shifts in perspective about what some functions should do and how the user should interact with them. This included changes to function arguments as well as some redefinition of what certain functions do.\r\n* Substantial code optimization was done, overhauling much of the package in the process.\r\n* Vectorized functions that previously only operated note by note.\r\n* Generalized functions that previously could accept notes but not chords, doing so on a case by case basis in ways that are meaningful and sensible for handling chords.\r\n* Added new classes `noteinfo` to complement `noteworthy` and associated functions.\r\n* Added new class `music` which builds upon the combination of `noteworthy` and `noteinfo`, similar in content to `phrase` but maintaining the structure of the other `tabr` classes for data manipulation and analysis.\r\n* Added implementations for several common R functions including primitives like `c`, `length`, `[` and more to be used with special classes available in `tabr`.\r\n* Added logical operator methods for the `noteworthy` class.\r\n* Refactored some basic metadata functions as generics to dispatch to the new classes rather than only working for `noteworthy` objects. For example, `time_format`.\r\n* Added native triplet support in note info using the `t`-prefix, e.g., `4 4] t8 t8- t8^ 4`. Support extends to `music` objects and now also to `phrase`, which alleviates reliance on the `triplet` function and its limitations.\r\n* Added `lyrics` class that parallels the structure and behavior of the other classes; added associated functions and generic method implementations.\r\n* Added `lyrics` support to `music` object construction and transformations.\r\n* Added lyrics argument to `track*` functions to support combining lyrics with an existing `phrase` object.\r\n* Added `render_music_*` functions for making simple sheet music snippets directly from `music` objects. This abstracts the `phrase() %>% track() [%>% trackbind()] %>% score() %>% render_*()` pipeline from the user for simpler music that is essentially a single voice, single track.\r\n* Added `plot_music_*` function wrappers around corresponding `render_music_*` functions to further abstract the external LilyPond process.\r\n* Added support for `render_music_*` and `plot_music_*` functions to automatically handle lyrics contained in a music object.\r\n* Added support for auto-cropping of rendered sheet music when the output format is png.\r\n* Added transparent background png support.\r\n* Added a `colors` argument that takes a named list of color overrides for `lilypond` and `render_*` functions.\r\n* Added MIDI file read support (requires optional `tuneR` installation) and a set of functions for inspecting and manipulating the table of MIDI music data.\r\n* Added initial support for conversion of MIDI file input to `noteworthy`, `noteinfo`, `music` and `phrase` classes so the MIDI data can be analyzed, transformed, edited and rendered to sheet music and a new MIDI file.\r\n* Added more functions for music data manipulation and analysis.\r\n* Added more functions for mapping between noteworthy strings, phrase objects, and data frames.\r\n* Added functions for summarizing times and durations in `noteinfo` and `music` objects.\r\n* Added syntax converters `from_chorrrds` (for chord output from `chorrrds` package) and `from_music21`, for converting other music notation syntax to `tabr` syntax.\r\n* Added `track_*` wrapper functions to provide better default track arguments for different instruments and use cases.\r\n* Added `render_tab` alias to `tab` for consistent naming, and other functions `render_score` and `render_midi` as simpler wrappers around `tab` with appropriate fewer arguments and appropriate argument defaults.\r\n* Added new vignettes on syntax conversion and rendering chord charts.\r\n* Updated vignettes, readme and other documentation.\r\n* Made improvements to print method for phrase objects.\r\n* Added `rests` argument to some note metadata functions.\r\n* Breaking change: Added support for many articulations. Some have abbreviated syntax options beginning with a hyphen: `-.`, `--`, `-+`, etc. Otherwise spelled out in bracketed text: `-.` is the same as `[staccato]`. The break is that the old form of staccato `]` is no longer allowed. Switch to `-.` or `[staccato]`. The leading `-` does not cause conflict with the single `-`, which continues to represent slide notation.\r\n* No more need (or support for) the `s`-suffix string numbering. All instances of single string number inputs are assumed starting string and any additional strings are inferred consecutively.\r\n* Improvements to `plot_fretboard` (renamed from `fretboard_plot`) and added wrapper function `plot_chord` for more convenient chord diagrams.\r\n* Minor bug fixes.\r\n* Significantly simplified LilyPond syntax for generated LilyPond files by adding `simplify_phrase` and the new (default) argument to `lilypond`, `simplify = TRUE`, which is also used by associated `render_*` functions.\r\n* Thank you to [fnord-repeater](https://github.com/fnord-repeater) for several helpful suggestions and insights as well as example code that helped to make the transcription pipeline better.\r\n* Thank you to [Han Oostdijk](https://github.com/HanOostdijk) for additional bug fixes and improvements to the code for the transcription pipeline.\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leonawicz/tabr/tarball/v0.4.0", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leonawicz/tabr/zipball/v0.4.0", "html_url": "https://github.com/leonawicz/tabr/releases/tag/v0.4.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/leonawicz/tabr/releases/21968266", "release_id": 21968266, "date_created": "2019-11-30T15:52:40Z", "date_published": "2019-12-04T16:08:52Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/leonawicz/tabr/releases/20661896", "tag": "v0.3.5", "name": "tabr 0.3.5 release", "author": {"name": "leonawicz", "type": "User"}, "description": "* Added alternate input specification for `sf_phrase`.
