Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project contributors.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nIf a contributor engages in harassing behaviour, the project organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expelling them from online forums, online project resources, face-to-face meetings, or any other project-related activity or resource.\n\nIf you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the project team immediately.  Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.  The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.  Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.\n\n## Attribution\n\nPortions of this Code of Conduct were adapted from Electron's [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which itself was adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4), version 1.4.\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/OH-demo/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md"}], "readme_url": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/OH-demo/main/README.md", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "continuous_integration": [{"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/OH-demo/main/.github/workflows/codemeta2cff.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}, {"result": {"value": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/OH-demo/main/.github/workflows/render.yml", "type": "Url"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration"}], "type": [{"result": {"value": "static-website", "type": "String"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "software_type_heuristics"}], "usage": [{"result": {"value": "Exploration of Oral Histories in markdown\n\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause)\n[![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/caltechlibrary/template.svg?style=flat-square&color=b44e88)](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/template/releases)\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "OH Demo"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/OH-demo/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "* [Introduction](#introduction)\n* [Installation](#installation)\n* [Usage](#usage)\n* [License](#license)\n* [Acknowledgments](#authors-and-acknowledgments)\n\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Table of contents", "parent_header": ["OH Demo"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/OH-demo/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"value": "To render on GitHub, simply make changes to index.Rmd, and the\nGitHub action will render the new page.
