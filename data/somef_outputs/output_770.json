Now it makes full use of the NCBI Taxonomy string, including the unnamed ranks, leading to higher resolution trees that have less multifurcations (#611) (#634)\r\n* Added support throughout package for use of NCBI Entrez API keys - NCBI now strongly encourages their use and you get a higher rate limit when you use one. See `?taxize-authentication` for help. Importantly, note that API key names (both R options and environment variables) have changed. They are now the same for R options and env vars: TROPICOS_KEY, EOL_KEY, PLANTMINER_KEY, ENTREZ_KEY. You no longer need an API key for Plantminer. (#640) (#646)\r\n* New author Zebulun Arendsee (@arendsee)\r\n* New package dependencies: `crul` and `zoo`\r\n\r\n### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\r\n\r\n* In `downstream()` we now pass on `limit` and `start` parameters to `gbif_downstream()`; we weren't doing that before; the two parameters control pagination (#638)\r\n*  `genbank2uid()` now returns the correct ID when there are multiple possibilities and invalid IDs no longer make whole batches fail (#642) thanks @zachary-foster\r\n* `children()` outputs made more consistent for certain cases when no results found for searches (#648) (#649) thanks @arendsee\r\n* Improve `downstream()` by passing `...` (additional parameters) down to `ncbi_children()` used internally. allows e.g., use of `ambiguous` parameter in `ncbi_children()` allows you to remove ambiguousl named nodes (#653) (#654) thanks @arendsee\r\n* swapped out use of `httr` for `crul` in EOL and Tropics functions - note that this won't affect you unless you're passing curl options. see package `crul` for help on curl options. Along with this change, the parameter `verbose` has changed to `messages` (for toggling printing of information messages)\r\n\r\n### DOCUMENTATION\r\n\r\n* Added additional text to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for how to contribute to the test suite (#635)\r\n\r\n### BUG FIXES\r\n\r\n* `genbank2uid` now returns the correct ID when there are multiple possibilities and invalid IDs no longer make whole batches fail.\r\n* Fix to `downstream()`: passing numeric taxon ids to the function while using `db=\"ncbi\"` wasn't working (#641) thanks @arendsee\r\n* Fix to `children()`: passing numeric taxon ids to the function while using `db=\"worms\"` wasn't working (#650) (#651) thanks @arendsee\r\n* `synonyms_df()` - that attemps to combine many outputs from the `synonyms()` function -  now removes NA/NULL/empy outputs before attempting the combination (#636)\r\n* Fix to `gnr_resolve()`: before if `preferred_data_sources` was used, you would get the preferred data but only a few columns of the response. We now return all fields; however, we only return the preferred data part when that parameter is used  (#656)\r\n* Fixes to `children()`. It was returning unexpected results for amgiguous taxonomic names (e.g., there's some insects that are returned when searching within Bacteria). It was also failing when one tried to get the children of a root taxon (e.g., the children of the NCBI id 131567). (#639) (#647) fixed via PR (#659) thanks @arendsee and @zachary-foster\r\n", "tarball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/taxize/tarball/v0.9.2", "zipball_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/taxize/zipball/v0.9.2", "html_url": "https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/releases/tag/v0.9.2", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/taxize/releases/9578604", "release_id": 9578604, "date_created": "2018-02-07T19:52:26Z", "date_published": "2018-02-07T20:15:59Z", "assets": []}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "GitHub_API"}, {"result": {"type": "Release", "value": "https://api.github.com/repos/ropensci/taxize/releases/7881456", "tag": "v0.9.0", "name": "taxize v0.9.0", "author": {"name": "sckott", "type": "User"}, "description": "### Changes to `get_*()` functions\r\n\r\n* Added separate documentation file for all get* functions\r\ndescribing attributes and various exception behaviors\r\n* Some `get*()` functions had `NaN` as default `rows` parameter\r\nvalue.

Methods so far for ITIS, NCBI, and GBIF (#505)\n- New contributor James O'Donnell (@jimmyodonnell) (via #505)\n- Now importing `rredlist` [rredlist](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/rredlist)\n- New function `iucn_summary_id()` - same as `iucn_summary()`, except takes\n  IUCN IDs as input instead of taxonomic names (#493)\n\n## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `iucn_summary()` fixes, long story short: a number of bug fixes, and uses\n  the new IUCN API via the newish package `rredlist` when IDs are given as input, \n  but uses the old IUCN API when taxonomic names given. Also: gains new parameter `distr_details`\n  (#174) (#472) (#487) (#488)\n- Replaced `XML` with `xml2` for XML parsing (#499)\n- Fixes to internal use of `httr::content` to explicitly state `encoding=\"UTF-8\"` (#498)\n- `gnr_resolve()` now outputs a column (`user_supplied_name`) for the exact input taxon \n  name - facilitates merging data back to original data inputs (#486) thanks @Alectoria\n- `eol_dataobjects()` gains new parameter `taxonomy` to toggle whether to return \n  any taxonomy details from different data providers (#497)\n- Catalogue of Life URLs changed - updated all appropriate COL functions to use \n  the new URLs (#501)\n- `classification()` was giving back rank values in mixed case from different data \n  providers (e.g., `class` vs. `Class`). All rank values are now all lowercase (#504)\n- Changed number of results returned from internal GBIF search in `get_gbfid` to \n  50 from 20. Gives back more results, so more likely to get the thing searched for (#513)\n- Fix to `gni_search()` to make all output columns `character` class\n- `iucn_id()`, `tpl_families()`, and `tpl_get()` all gain a new parameter `...` to \n  pass on curl options to `httr::GET()`\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- Fixes to `get_eolid()`: URI returned now always has the pageid, and goes to the \n  right place; API key if passed in now actually used, woopsy (#484)\n- Fixes to `get_uid()`: when a taxon not found, the \"match\" attribute was saying\n  found sometimes anyway - that is now fixed; additionally, fixed docs to correctly\n  state that we give back `'NA due to ask=FALSE'` when `ask = FALSE` (#489) Additionally, \n  made this doc fix in other `get_*()` function docs\n- Fix to `apgOrders()` function (#490)\n- Fixes to `tp_search()` which fixes `get_tpsid()`: Tropicos doesn't allow periods (`.`) in \n  query strings, so those are URL encoded now; Tropicos doesn't like sub-specific rank names\n  in name query strings, so we warn when those are found, but don't alter user inputs; and \n  improved docs to be more clear about how the function fails (#491) thanks @scelmendorf !\n- Fix to `classification(db = \"itis\")` to fail better when no taxa found (#495) thanks @ashenkin !\n- `eol_pages()` fixes: the EOL API route for this method gained a new parameter `taxonomy`, \n  this function gains that parameter. That change caused this fxn to fail. Now fixed. Also,\n  parameter `subject` changed to `subjects` (#500)\n- Fix to `col_search()` due to when `misapplied name` come back as a data slot.

That is, all taxonomic data sources available\n  in `taxize` use their own unique IDs, so a single ID value can be in multiple\n  data sources, even though the ID refers to different taxa in each data source.\n  There is no way we can think of to prevent this from happening, so be cautious.\n  (#465)\n- A note added to all IUCN functions to warn users that sometimes incorrect\n  data is returned.

Note, this is different from http://taxosaurus.org/ that is wrapped in the `tnrs()` function.\n- New function `ipni_search()` to search for names in the International Plant Names Index (IPNI).\n- New function `resolve()` that unifies name resolution services from iPlant's name resolution service (via `iplant_resolve()`), Taxosaurus' TNRS (via `tnrs()`), and GNR's name resolution service (via `gnr_resolve()`).\n- All `get_*()` functions how returning a new _uri_ attribute that is a link to the taxon on on the web. If NA is given back (e.g. nothing found), the uri attribute is blank. You can go directly to the uri in your default browser by doing, for example: `browseURL(attr(result, \"uri\"))`.\n- `get_eolid()` now returns an attribute _provider_ because EOL collates taxonomic data form a lot of sources, then gives back IDs that are internal EOL ids, not those matching the id of the source they pull from. This should help with provenance, and should help if there is confusion about why the id givenb back by this function does not match that from the original source.\n- Within the `get_tsn()` function, now using the function `itis_terms()`, which gives back the accepted status of the taxa. This allows a new parameter in the function (`accepted`, logical) that allows user to say give back only accepted status names (`accepted=TRUE`), or to give back all names (`accepted=FALSE`).\n- `gnr_resolve()` gains two new parameters `best_match_only` (logical, to return best match only) and `preferred_data_sources` (to return preferred data sources) and `callopts` to pass in curl options.\n- `tnrs()`, `tp_accnames()`, `tp_refs()`, `tp_summary()`, and `tp_synonyms()` gain new parameter `callopts` to pass in curl options.\n\n## MINOR IMPROVEMENTS\n- `class2tree()` can now handle NA in classification objects.\n- `classification.eolid()` and `classification.colid()` now return the submitted name along with the classification.\n- Changed from CC0 to MIT license.\n- Updated citation to have both the taxize paper in F1000 Research and the package citation.\n- Sped up some functions by removing internal use of `plyr` functions, see #275.\n- Removed dependency on rgbif - copied into this package a few functions needed internally. This avoids users having to install GDAL binary.\n- Added in `verbose` parameter to many more functions to allow suppression of help messages.\n- In most functions when using `httr`, now manually parsing JSON to a list then to another data format instead of allowing internal `httr` parsing - in addition added checks on content type and encoding in many functions.\n- Added `match.arg` iternally to `get_ids()` for the `db` parameter so that a) unique short abbreviations of possible values are possible, and b) gives a meaningful warning if unsupported values are given.\n- Most long-named ITIS functions (e.g., `getexpertsfromtsn`, `getgeographicdivisionsfromtsn`) gain parameter `curlopts` to pass in curl options.\n- Added `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` to all `data.frame` creations to eliminate factor variables.\n\n## BUG FIXES\n- `classification.gbifid()` did not return the correct result when taxon not found.\n- Fixed bugs in many functions, see #245, #248, #254, #277.\n- `classification()` used to fail when it was passed a subset of a vector of ids, in which case the class information was stripped off.

Please don't. It benefits everyone for discussions to happen in public where they're indexed by search engines, enabling users to find solutions to their problems from previous public discussions. \n\n## Code contributions\n\n### Broad overview of contributing workflow\n\n* Fork this repo to your Github account\n* Clone your version on your account down to your machine from your account, e.g,. `git clone https://github.com/<yourgithubusername>/taxize.git`\n* Make sure to track progress upstream (i.e., on our version of `taxize` at `ropensci/taxize`) by doing `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ropensci/taxize.git`. Before making changes make sure to pull changes in from upstream by doing either `git fetch upstream` then merge later or `git pull upstream` to fetch and merge in one step\n* Make your changes (bonus points for making changes on a new feature branch)\n* Please do write a test(s) for your changes if they affect code and not just docs (see Tests below)\n* Push up to your account\n* Submit a pull request to home base at `ropensci/taxize`\n\n### Tests\n\nTo add tests, go to the folder `tests/testthat/`. Tests are generally organized as individual files for each exported function from the package (that is, listed as an export in the `NAMESPACE` file). If you are adding a new exported function, add a new test file. If you are changing an existing function, work in the tests file for that function, unless it doesn't have tests, in which case make a new test file.\n\nThe book R packages book provides [a chapter on testing in general](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html). Do consult that first if you aren't familiar with testing in R.\n\nThe easiest set up to run tests is from within an R session:\n\n```r\nlibrary(devtools)\nlibrary(testthat)\n# loads the package\nload_all()\n```\n\nTo test an individual test file\n\n```r\ntest_file(\"tests/testthat/test-foobar.R\")\n```\n\nTo run all tests\n\n```r\ndevtools::test()\n```\n\nIf you are running tests that have `skip_on_cran()` in them, set `Sys.setenv(NOT_CRAN = \"true\")` prior to running tests.\n\n\n### Making changes\n\nIn addition to changing the code, do make sure to udpate the documentation if applicable. The R packages book book has a [chapter on documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) you should read if you aren't familiar.\n\nAfter code and documentation has been changed, update documentation by running either `devtools::document()` or `roxygen2::roxygenise()`.\n\nMake sure if you change what packages or even functions within packages are imported, most likely add the package to Imports in the DESCRIPTION file and list what functions are imported in the `taxize-package.R` file.\n\nBe conservative about adding new dependencies.\n\n\n### Style\n\n* Make sure code, documentation, and comments are no more than 80 characters in width.\n* Use `<-` instead of `=` for assignment\n* Always use `snake_case` (and all lowercase) instead of `camelCase`\n\n## Also, check out our [discussion forum](https://discuss.ropensci.org)\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/taxize/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md"}, {"result": {"value": "See our\n[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/ropensci/taxize/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)\ndocument.\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Contributing", "parent_header": ["taxize"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/taxize/master/README.Rmd"}], "installation": [{"result": {"value": "``` r\ninstall.packages(\"taxize\")\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Stable version from CRAN", "parent_header": ["taxize", "Installation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/taxize/master/README.Rmd"}, {"result": {"value": "Windows users install Rtools first.\n\n``` r\ninstall.packages(\"remotes\")\nremotes::install_github(\"ropensci/taxize\")\n```\n\n``` r\nlibrary('taxize')\n```\n", "type": "Text_excerpt", "original_header": "Development version from GitHub", "parent_header": ["taxize", "Installation"]}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "header_analysis", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/taxize/master/README.Rmd"}], "contributors": [{"result": {"value": "Collected via GitHub Issues: honors all contributors in alphabetical\norder.
