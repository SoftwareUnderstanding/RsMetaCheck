Specifically Newt is focused on creating web based metadata curation tools. These types of applications are commonly needed in galleries, libraries, archives and museums (abbr: GLAM). Newt makes creating these type of applications easier. \nHow does Newt do that? Newt generates an application by implementing a [service oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) using a combination of off the shelf software and generated code. \nYou can think of a web application as a sequence of requests and responses. Traditionally a web browser contacts your web site or application then one of two things will happen. Your app knows the answer and hands back the result. Alternatively if it doesn't know the answer it tells you it can't do so (e.g. 404 HTTP STATUS CODE). With service oriented architecture your application has another option. Your application can contact another service and use that result to answer the request from the web browser.  Newt's implements a service oriented architecture by orchestrating data processing pipelines[^11]. \n[^11]: A data pipeline is formed by taking the results from one web service and using it as the input to another web service. It is the web equivalent of Unix pipes. Prior art: [Yahoo! Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes) \nWith data pipelines we can accept a request and feed that request to one service then take its output and send it to the next service. Newt does this by providing a data router. Newt can manage the request sequence through a simple YAML described pipeline. While it is possible to create pipelines using Apache and NginX proxy features in practice that approach quickly becomes an unmanageable configuration problem. You could encapsulate clusters of processes in containers but this too becomes complex to manage. Newt's router can cut through the hairball of configurations and define pipelines per request route. With Newt's pipelines the last service completed hands its result back to Newt's router which returns the result to the web browser. \nWhy is this important? Much of the \"back end\" of a web application is already available as off the shelf software. Here is a short list of examples used by Caltech Library. \n- [Postgres](https://postgres.org) and [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org) provides a JSON API for data management\n- [Dataset](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset), a simple JSON document store that has an out of the box JSON API provided by [datasetd](https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset/datasetd.1.html).\n- [Solr](https://solr.apache.org) and Elasticsearch, OpenSearch can provide full text search as a JSON web service\n- [ArchivesSpace](https://archivesspace.org) provides a JSON API web service\n- [Invenio RDM](https://inveniordm.docs.cern.ch/) provides a JSON API web service\n- [Cantaloupe IIIF Image server](https://cantaloupe-project.github.io/) an IIIF [API](https://iiif.io/api/image/3.0/) \n__This is not an exhaustive list__. These types of applications can all be integrated into your application through configuring the connection in Newt's YAML file. Newt's router runs the data pipelines and can host static content. \nMetadata oriented applications share the following operations -- create, retrieve, update, delete and list. These are called CRUD-L[^12] features. Customization tend towards data models.  Newt's configuration file includes simple YAML description of your data models. It uses the data model to render configuration, middleware and templates. Newt's data router ties them all together into an application using service oriented architecture. \n- a simple data modeler\n- code generation\n- template engine\n- data routing \n", "original_header": "Newt Project"}, "confidence": 0.9276760500802377, "technique": "supervised_classification", "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caltechlibrary/newt/main/README.md"}, {"result": {"type": "Text_excerpt", "value": "Newt is a narrowly focused rapid application development toolbox. Newt will not clean your house or make a cocktail. Additionally it does not support the class of web applications that handle file uploads. That means it is not a replacement for Drupal, WordPress, Islandora, etc. Newt is for building applications more in line with ArchivesSpace but with simpler data models. If you need file upload support Newt is not the right solution at this time. \nNewt applications are well suited to interacting with other applications that provide a JSON API. A service with a JSON API can be treated as a JSON data source. A JSON data source can easily be run through a pipeline. Many GLAM applications like ArchivesSpace and Invenio RDM provide JSON API. It is possible to extended those systems by creating simpler services that can talk to those JSON data sources. Newt is well suited to this \"development at the edges\" approach. \nServices not available on localhost must be proxied to integrate with your Newt application. Why is this necessary? Short answer, security. Newt seeks to reduce the attack surface of your web application as much as possible. It does that by only trusting services offered directly on localhost.  Newt's application models presumes you're running behind a \"front end web server\" like Apache 2, NginX or Lighttd. These systems can be configured to provide access control as well as perform proxy services. The front end web server is your first line of defense against a cracker. \nExternal web services integrate through a proxy setup (e.g ORCID, ROR, CrossRef or DataCite). This can be done via the front end web server or by writing a dedicated proxy service.  Today writing proxy services us easily accomplished in most popular programming languages due to good support for web protocols.

Middleware however remains complex. I believe this to be a by product of inertia in software development practices and the assumption that what is good for \"Google Scale\" is good for everyone. \nI think a radical simplification is due.  **Newt is intended to spark that conversation**. My observation is most software doesn't need to scale large. In the research and GLAM communities we don't routinely write software that scales as large as [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/).  We don't typically support tens of thousands of simultaneous users. I think we can focus our efforts around orchestrating off the shelf components and put our remaining development time into improving the human experience using our software. A better human experience is an intended side effect of Newt. \nA big key to simplification is narrowing the focus of our middleware.

This is true even without using Newt. There is a problem though.  If we only use the above software to build our application we must rely on JavaScript (or WASM module) running in the web browser to interact with the server. This sounds simple. In practice this is a terrible idea[^17]. \nWhat we should do is use Newt to tie those JSON services together and send rendered HTML back to the web browser. Newt's router provides static file service and a means of pipelining our JSON data source through a template engine. Newt provides a Handlebars[^18] template engine for that purpose.

The Newt approach uses less bandwidth, fewer network accesses and less computations cycles on your viewing device. The Newt approach takes advantage of what the web browser is really good at without turning your web pages into a web service. Newt YAML describes the system you want.

It is optional if not specified it assume the render engine runs on port 3030 like Pandoc server.\r\n\r\nIn the Newt YAML file, `newt_routes` is now `routes`, there is still a `routes_file` attribute if you need to read in a separate file (e.g. a CSV file of routes). `newt_env` is not ` env`. \r\n\r\nAdded man pages for `newt`, `newtpg` and `newtmustache`. \r\n\r\nWe're still in the prototype

This doesn't replace the recommendations at the [Pandoc Website](https://pandoc.org). It's the my notes about how I got things up on my Mac Mini with an M1 process while using Mac Ports. The basic recipe is modified because of a potential link conflict in which libiconv if you've also installed Mac Ports to get reliable development tools like Git. Pandoc needs to link against the macOS supplied libiconv but Mac Ports also provides this and the Git that comes with Mac Ports relies on the Mac Ports libiconv. The trick then is to do all the Git commands before \nbefore temporarily uninstalling the libiconv that comes with Mac Ports. You can then invoking Cabal and put libiconv back afterward Pandoc installation is complete.

It provides a data router, code generator and Mustache template engine. At this time you must install it from source code. The programs are likely broken, poorly documented and certainly contain bugs. It's a prototype!\n\nQuick install with curl or irm\n------------------------------\n\nIf you are running macOS or Linux you can install released versions of newt\nwith the following curl command.\n\n~~~\ncurl https://caltechlibrary.github.io/newt/installer.sh\n~~~\n\nIn Powershell on Windows you can use the following command\n\n~~~\nirm https://caltechlibrary.github.io/newt/installer.ps1 | iex\n~~~\n\n\nInstall from source\n-------------------\n\n## Installation Requirements\n\n- Go >= 1.22.5\n- Deno >= 1.44\n- Pandoc > 3.1 (to render Markdown content and some Go code)\n- Git compatible tool for retrieving the GitHub repository of Newt\n- GNU Make > 4\n- GNU grep > 3\n- GNU cut  > 8\n\n### Building from source code\n\n1. Make sure you have the required development software installed\n2. Clone the Newt GitHub repository locally\n3. Use the Go tool to build, test and run the application\n\n##### step 1\n\nMake sure you have the necessary software installed first. The list is below.  If you are building on Windows you'll need to use the LSW to follow along and the tools will need to be available in the WSL. Otherwise the steps are generally similar for macOS, Windows and Linux.\n\n- Go >= 1.22.5\n- Deno >= 1.44\n- Pandoc > 3.1 (to render Markdown content and some Go code)\n- Git cli or compatible tool for retrieving the GitHub repository of Newt\n- GNU Make > 4\n- GNU grep > 3\n- GNU cut  > 8\n\n#### step 2\n\n1. Start in your home directory\n2. Clone Newt's [repository](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/newt).\n3. Change into the Newt directory\n\nFrom the terminal application running a POSIX shell I type the following.\n\n~~~shell\ncd\ngit clone \\\n   https://github.com/caltechlibrary/newt \\\n   src/github.com/caltechlibrary/newt\ncd src/github.com/caltechlibrary/newt\n~~~\n\n#### step 3\n\nFor step three tasks you have two choices. You can use the Go command Or you can run the Make command. The latter has the advantage that it'll build help docuemntaiton, man pages and install the man pages in your home directory.\n\nIt assumed you are still in the directory where you completed step 2.\n\n1. Build the newt application\n2. Test the newt application\n3. If the tests are successful then you can install Newt tools\n\nHere's the Go command version.\n\n~~~shell\ngo build\ngo test\ngo install\n~~~\n\nHere's the Make version.\n\n~~~\nmake\nmake test\nmake install\n~~~\n\n<!--\n\n## Precompiled binaries\n\nYou can find prep-compiled binaries for some versions of Newt. They are available at <https://github.com/caltechlibrary/newt/releases>.\n\nThe binaries are available in a Zip archive file for download. The name uses the form `newt-<VERSION_NO>-<OS_TYPE>-<CPU_TYPE>.zip`. VERSION_NO will be a semver associated with the release (e.g. \"v0.0.2\"), the OS_TYPE will be either \"Linux\" (including Raspberry Pi OS), \"Windows\" and \"macOS\". The CPU_TYPE will vary based on how the CPU type is reported on the POSIX system (e.g. what is returned by `uname -m`) or in the case of Windows either \"x86_64\" for Intel CPU types or \"arm64\" for ARM CPU (e.g. those in selected Surface tablets or Microsoft's ARM Development Kit 2023).\n\n- macOS example\n  - `newt-v0.0.2-macOS-arm64.zip` (M1, M2 CPU)\n  - `newt-v0.0.2-macOS-x86_64.zip` (older Intel based Macs)\n- Windows example\n  - `newt-v0.0.2-Windows-x86_64.zip` (for Most Windows machines)\n- Linux example (including Raspberry Pi OS)\n  - `newt-v0.0.2-Linux-x86_64.zip` (Linux on Intel CPUs)\n  - `newt-v0.0.2-Linux-aarch64.zip` (Linux on ARM 64)\n\n-->\n\n## Getting help\n\n**The Newt Project is an experiment!!**.
