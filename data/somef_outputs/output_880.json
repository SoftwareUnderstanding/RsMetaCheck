welcome!\nYou can contribute in various ways, e.g. by\n\n-   providing feedback\n-   asking questions\n-   suggesting ideas\n-   implementing features\n-   fixing problems\n-   improving documentation\n\nTo make contributing to open source projects a good experience to everyone involved,\nplease make sure that you follow our code of conduct when communicating with others.\n\n## Ideas, Questions and Problems\n\nIf you have questions or difficulties using this software,\nplease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/maximiliani/nmr_FAIR-DOs/issues).\n\nIf your topic is not already covered by an existing issue,\nplease create a new issue using one of the provided issue templates.\n\nIf your issue is caused by incomplete, unclear or outdated documentation,\nwe are also happy to get suggestions on how to improve it.\nOutdated or incorrect documentation is a _bug_,\nwhile missing documentation is a _feature request_.\n\n**NOTE:** If you want to report a critical security problem, _do not_ open an issue!\nInstead, please create a [private security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability),\nor contact the current package maintainers directly by e-mail.\n\n## Development\n\nThis project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management.\n\nYou can run the following lines to check out the project and prepare it for development:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/maximiliani/nmr_FAIR-DOs\ncd nmr_FAIR-DOs\npoetry install --with docs\npoetry run poe init-dev\n```\n\nCommon tasks are accessible via [poe](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet):\n\n-   Use `poetry run poe lint` to run linters manually, add `--all-files` to check everything.\n\n-   Use `poetry run poe test` to run tests, add `--cov` to also show test coverage.\n\n-   Use `poetry run poe docs` to generate local documentation\n\nIn order to contribute code, please open a pull request.\n\nBefore opening the PR, please make sure that your changes\n\n-   are sufficiently covered by meaningful **tests**,\n-   are reflected in suitable **documentation** (API docs, guides, etc.), and\n-   successfully pass all pre-commit hooks.\n",

appropriate and fair corrective action in\nresponse to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,\nor harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject\ncomments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are\nnot aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation\ndecisions when appropriate.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when\nan individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.\nExamples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,\nposting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be\nreported to the project maintainers by e-mail.\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the\nreporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining\nthe consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of\nactions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent\nban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\ncommunity.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.1, available at\n[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1].\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by\n[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder][Mozilla CoC].\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\n[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq][FAQ].
