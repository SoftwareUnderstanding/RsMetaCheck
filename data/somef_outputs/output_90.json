Poetry\n\nFor installing Poetry on your system, please visit the official Poetry documentation [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).\n\n#### Install project dependencies\nRun the following command in the root of the repository to install dependencies:\n```bash\npoetry install\n```\n\n# Installing through Docker\n\nWe provide a Docker image with the scripts already installed. To run through Docker, you may build the Dockerfile provided in the repository by running:\n\n```bash\ndocker build -t ai-open-science .\n```\n\nThen, to run your image just type:\n\n```bash\ndocker run --rm -it  ai-open-science\n```\n\nAnd you will be ready to use the scripts (see section below).
