By contributing to this\nproject, you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## How you can contribute\n\nThere are several ways you can contribute to this project. If you want to know\nmore about why and how to contribute to open source projects like this one, see\nthis [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).\n\n### Share the love \u2764\ufe0f\n\nThink `repometrics` is useful? Let others discover it, by telling them in person,\nvia Twitter or a blog post.\n\nUsing `repometrics` for a paper you are writing? Consider [citing\nit](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/blob/main/inst/CITATION).\n\n### Ask a question \u2049\ufe0f\n\nUsing `repometrics` and got stuck? [Browse the\ndocumentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/repometrics/) to see if you can find a\nsolution. Still stuck? Post your question as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/issues). While we\ncannot offer user support, we'll try to do our best to address it, as questions\noften lead to better documentation or the discovery of bugs.\n\nWant to ask a question in private? Contact the package maintainer by\n[email](mailto:mark@ropensci.org).\n\n### Propose an idea \ud83d\udca1\n\nHave an idea for a new `repometrics` feature? Take a look at [the\ndocumentation](https://docs.ropensci.org/repometrics/) and [issues\nlist](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/issues) to see if it\nisn't included or suggested yet. If not, suggest your idea as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/issues/new).\nWhile we can't promise to implement your idea, it helps to:\n\n* Explain in detail how it would work.\n* Keep the scope as narrow as possible.\n\nSee below if you want to contribute code for your idea as well.\n\n### Report a bug \ud83d\udc1b\n\nUsing `repometrics` and discovered a bug? That's annoying! Don't let others have\nthe same experience and report it as an [issue on\nGitHub](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/issues/new) so we can\nfix it. A good bug report makes it easier for us to do so, so please:\n\n- Use [the `reprex` package](https://reprex.tidyverse.org) to create a\n  reproducible example.\n- Include the version of `repometrics` with the following line in your `reprex`\n  code:\n  ```\n  packageVersion(\"repometrics\")\n  ```\n\n### Improve the documentation \ud83d\udcd6\n\nNoticed a typo on the website? Think a function could use a better example?\nGood documentation makes all the difference, so your help to improve it is very\nwelcome!\n\n#### The website\n\n[This website](https://docs.ropensci.org/repometrics/) is generated with\n[`pkgdown`](http://pkgdown.r-lib.org/). That means we don't have to write any\nhtml: content is pulled together from documentation in the code, vignettes,\n[Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files, the\npackage `DESCRIPTION` and `_pkgdown.yml` settings. If you know your way around\n`pkgdown`, you can [propose a file\nchange](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)\nto improve documentation. If not, [report an\nissue](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/issues/new) and we can\npoint you in the right direction.\n\n#### Function documentation\n\nFunctions are described as comments near their code and translated to\ndocumentation using [`roxygen2`](https://klutometis.github.io/roxygen/). If you\nwant to improve a function description:\n\n1. Go to `R/` directory in the [code\n   repository](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/tree/main/R).\n2. Look for the file with the name of the function.\n3. [Propose a file\n   change](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/)\n   to update the function documentation in the roxygen comments (starting with\n   `#'`).\n\n### Contribute code \ud83d\udcdd\n\nCare to fix bugs or implement new functionality for `repometrics`? Awesome! \ud83d\udc4f\nHave a look at the [issue\nlist](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/issues) and leave a\ncomment on the things you want to work on. See also the development guidelines\nbelow.\n\n## Development guidelines\n\nWe try to follow the [GitHub\nflow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) for development.\n\n1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/repometrics/) and\n   clone it to your computer. To learn more about this process, see [this\n   guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n2. If you have forked and cloned the project before and it has been a while\n   since you worked on it, [pull changes from the original\n   repo](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-an-upstream-repository-into-your-fork/)\n   to your clone by using `git pull upstream master`.\n3. Open the RStudio project file (`.Rproj`).\n4. Make your changes:\n    * Write your code.\n    * Test your code (bonus points for adding unit tests).\n    * Document your code (see function documentation above).\n    * Check your code with `devtools::check()` and aim for 0 errors and warnings.\n5. Commit and push your changes.\n6. Submit a [pull\n   request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request).\n\n## Code style\n\nThe `repometrics` coding style diverges somewhat from [the commonly used tidyverse\nstyle guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html#spacing), primarily\nthrough judicious use of\nwhitespace, which aims to improve code readability. Code references in\n`repometrics` are separated by whitespace, just like words of text. Just like it\nis easier to understand \"these three words\" than \"thesethreewords\", code is \nformatted like this:\n\n``` r\nthese <- three (words (x))\n```\n\nand not like this:\n\n``` r\nthese <- three(words(x))\n```\n\nThe position of brackets is then arbitrary, and we could also write\n\n``` r\nthese <- three( words (x))\n```\n\n`repometrics` code opts for the former style, with the natural result that one\nends up writing\n\n```r\nthis <- function ()\n```\n\nwith a space between `function` and `()`. You can easily (re-)format your code\nto accord with this style [by installing the `spaceout`\npackage](https://github.com/ropensci-review-tools/spaceout) and running:\n\n```r\nstyler::style_pkg (style = spaceout::spaceout_style)\n```\n", "type": "File_dump"}, "confidence": 1, "technique": "file_exploration", "source":
