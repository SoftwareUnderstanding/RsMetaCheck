Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed\nunprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing\nclarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the\nbehavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of\nactions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No\ninteraction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with\nthose enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This\nincludes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels\nlike social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent\nban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including\nsustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public\ncommunication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or\nprivate interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction\nwith those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.\nViolating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community\nstandards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an\nindividual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the\ncommunity.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage],\nversion 2.0,\navailable at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html>.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct\nenforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\n<https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq>.

If you haven't done this before, we recommend using `usethis::create_from_github(\"karissawhiting/cbioportalR\", fork = TRUE)`.\n\n*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. \n    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. \n*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). We recommend using `usethis::pr_init(\"brief-description-of-change\")`.\n\n*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR by running `usethis::pr_push()`, and following the prompts in your browser.\n    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.\n    The body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`.\n\n*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.\n\n### Code style\n\n*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). \n    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  \n\n*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  \n\n*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. \n   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  \n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nPlease note that the cbioportalR project is released with a\n[Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This can be useful when working\nwithin a very large database or working across samples housed in\nmultiple different studies. When querying by `sample_id` you must also\nspecify the corresponding `study_id` in which the samples are housed.\nWhen these pieces of information are not provided, {cbioportalR} makes\nan informed guess based on your connection and will throw an informative\nmessage to clarify exactly what is being queried. In the example below,\nthe function defaults to the public version of the IMPACT database\n(`study_id = \"msk_impact_2017\"`).\n\n``` r\nsamples <- available_samples(study_id = \"acc_tcga\") %>%\n  pull(sampleId) %>%\n  head(n = 10)\n\nmutations <- get_mutations_by_sample(sample_id =  samples)\n#> The following parameters were used in query:\n#> Study ID: \"msk_impact_2017\"\n#> Molecular Profile ID: \"msk_impact_2017_mutations\"\n#> Genes: \"All available genes\"\n\n# no results returned because these samples are not in this study\nlength(mutations) == 0\n#> [1] TRUE\n```\n\nNo results were returned because the samples are not stored in this\nstudy. When we specify the correct study (`study_id = \"acc_tcga\"`), we\nget accurate results. You can check which samples are stored in a study\nusing `available_samples(study_id = \"acc_tcga\")`.\n\n``` r\nmutations <- get_mutations_by_sample(sample_id =  samples,\n                                    study_id = \"acc_tcga\")\n#> The following parameters were used in query:\n#> Study ID: \"acc_tcga\"\n#> Molecular Profile ID: \"acc_tcga_mutations\"\n#> Genes: \"All available genes\"\n\nmutations %>%\n  head()\n#> # A tibble: 6 \u00d7 28\n#>   hugoGeneSymbol entrezGeneId uniqueSampleKey                  uniquePatientKey \n#>   <chr>                 <int> <chr>                            <chr>            \n#> 1 KRT8                   3856 VENHQS1PUi1BNUoxLTAxOmFjY190Y2dh VENHQS1PUi1BNUox\u2026\n#> 2 LCE1B                353132 VENHQS1PUi1BNUoxLTAxOmFjY190Y2dh VENHQS1PUi1BNUox\u2026\n#> 3 DNAH14               127602 VENHQS1PUi1BNUoxLTAxOmFjY190Y2dh VENHQS1PUi1BNUox\u2026\n#> 4 KLRB1                  3820 VENHQS1PUi1BNUoxLTAxOmFjY190Y2dh VENHQS1PUi1BNUox\u2026\n#> 5 SALL2                  6297 VENHQS1PUi1BNUoxLTAxOmFjY190Y2dh VENHQS1PUi1BNUox\u2026\n#> 6 TMEM266              123591 VENHQS1PUi1BNUoxLTAxOmFjY190Y2dh VENHQS1PUi1BNUox\u2026\n#> # \u2139 24 more variables: molecularProfileId <chr>, sampleId <chr>,\n#> #   patientId <chr>, studyId <chr>, center <chr>, mutationStatus <chr>,\n#> #   validationStatus <chr>, tumorAltCount <int>, tumorRefCount <int>,\n#> #   normalAltCount <int>, normalRefCount <int>, startPosition <int>,\n#> #   endPosition <int>, referenceAllele <chr>, proteinChange <chr>,\n#> #   mutationType <chr>, ncbiBuild <chr>, variantType <chr>, keyword <chr>,\n#> #   chr <chr>, variantAllele <chr>, refseqMrnaId <chr>, \u2026\n```\n\nLastly, you can also pull clinical data or sample metadata (e.g.\u00a0tumor\nsample site) by study ID, sample ID or patient ID.
